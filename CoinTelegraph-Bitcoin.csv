Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

Claiming a combined total of $943 million in cryptocurrency assets as of March 31, 2023, the filing shows a 56% increase over the company’s previous quarter where PayPal disclosed $604 million.

PayPal’s reported total financial liabilities for this quarter were $1.2 billion, with crypto assets making up 77.9% — up more than 10% from 2022’s reported fourth quarter liabilities.

According to the report, PayPal considers its crypto assets a “safeguarding liability” due to the “unique risks associated with cryptocurrencies.” The disclosure also indicates that the specific cryptocurrencies held by the company remain unchanged since last quarter:

“We allow our customers in certain markets to buy, hold, sell, receive, and send certain cryptocurrencies as well as use the proceeds from sales of cryptocurrencies to pay for purchases at checkout. These cryptocurrencies consist of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin (collectively, ‘our customers’ crypto assets’).”

Custody of the assets PayPal holds on behalf of its customers remains limited to third-party holding companies. PayPal recognizes that this presents a liability for customers in the event that third parties are unable to process transactions — a statement carried over from last quarter’s filing — however, the filing also indicates that no such fault has yet occurred:

“As of March 31, 2023, the Company has not incurred any safeguarding loss events, and therefore, the crypto asset safeguarding liability and corresponding safeguarding asset were recorded at the same value.”

The Q1 2023 cryptocurrency asset breakdown for PayPal includes $499 million in Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,752

 (up from December’s $291 million), $362 million in Ether 

ETH

$1,853

 (up from $250 million), and $82 million composed of Bitcoin Cash 

BCH

$121

 and Litecoin 

LTC

$79.38

 (up from $63 million).

PayPal’s profitability also increased in the first quarter. On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, the company disclosed per-share earnings of $0.70, up from $0.43 in the first quarter of 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, PayPal’s per-share earnings were $1.17, up from $0.88 in the first quarter of 2022.

According to data from CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, the current market price of Bitcoin amounts to $27,722, which is roughly 2% less than Bitcoin’s price quoted on Binance.US.

The highest intraday price of Bitcoin on Binance.US amounted to as much as $28,600, while the intraday high for its market price only equaled $28,004. In the meantime, Bitcoin’s lowest intraday values ranged from $27,350 to $27,669 on Binance.US.

Binance.US’ Bitcoin premium comes shortly after Binance, the main global exchange, suffered major withdrawal issues on May 7.

The exchange was forced to close withdrawals amid Bitcoin facing unusual mempool congestion, with more than 400,000 transactions getting stuck on the Bitcoin blockchain. The event apparently triggered Binance to finally consider the addition of the Lightning Network on its platform, which is designed to speed up BTC transactions and make them less expensive.

The price of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,752

 has fallen three days in a row as traders assess many downside factors, including higher transaction fees and bearish signals for risk-on markets from legendary investor Warren Buffett.

BTC price dropped below $27,500 on May 9, down 8% from its local high of $29,850 established three days ago. Moreover, the dip accompanied a rise in trading volumes, suggesting the move has momentum behind it.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

H&S pattern hints at BTC price below $25K

Bitcoin price risks dropping below $25,000 in the short term from a technical standpoint.

The downside target is based on Bitcoin's head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern, confirmed by three peak formations atop a common support level. The middle peak, called the ""head,"" is taller than the other two — the left and right shoulders — which are almost equal in height.

As a rule of technical analysis, a decisive break below the H&S support level near $27,500 could have the price fall by as much as the pattern's maximum height, i.e., the distance between the head and the support level. 

That raises the possibility of Bitcoin dropping to $24,750 by June, down about 10% from current price levels.

Moreover, independent market analyst Cold Blooded Shiller anticipates the Bitcoin price declining to $25,000, a former weekly resistance, within the next two days.

""I still think that if this snaps the structure it's going to move very quickly (24-48 hours) towards that Weekly level,"" the analyst tweeted, adding: 

""[$27.5K] is one of the better potential defense points for BTC, but the crypto market has been trading incredibly weakly. Way out of line with its usual correlation to either indexes or metals.""

Conversely, a high-volumed rebound from the H&S support would invalidate the bearish setup. A recovery toward $30,000 will then be back on the table.

April's CPI data release

Bitcoin's price has declined in the days leading up to the release of the U.S. inflation data on May 10.

Notably, the core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes food and energy, for April could come near 5.5%, almost the same as the previous month, according to Bloomberg.

This persistent CPI reading means the Federal Reserve would need to continue its interest rate hikes to bring inflation down to its preferred target of 2%.

Higher interest rates tend to decrease investors' appetite for riskier zero-yielding assets like Bitcoin, a fundamental that aligns with the H&S price target for BTC/USD as mentioned above.

Nonetheless, Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last week that they would pause rate hikes in June to study how the U.S. economy has responded to higher interest rates and the ongoing banking sector crisis.

He denied the possibility of rate cuts, despite the Fed funds futures’ data expressing the likelihood of at least five rate cuts — a potential buy-signal for Bitcoin investors — between May 2023 and January 2024.

Bloomberg economists:

“Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at the May FOMC meeting that rates might already be ‘sufficiently restrictive’ — but he needs more time to observe developments before he can have confidence in that judgment. Neither April’s CPI nor PPI prints will be reassuring, with both expected to show headline inflation accelerating.”

A new blockchain network aimed at financial institutions is in the works from a conglomerate of participants in the finance and tech space, including the likes of Microsoft and Goldman Sachs.

According to the announcement on May 9, the Canton Network will be a privacy-enabled interoperable blockchain network aimed at those working with institutional assets. It will allow the synchronization of financial markets that were “previously siloed.”

The network will begin testing its capabilities in July, which include extensive privacy controls and the ability to achieve the scale and performance needed by major financial institutions. Participants in the network currently include BNP Paribas, Cboe Global Markets, Digital Asset, Paxos, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Deloitte and others.

Cathy Clay, executive vice president of Cboe Global Markets — one of the partners in the project — said that, when leveraged, blockchain technology can potentially “unlock” new opportunities in the market.

“The tokenization of real-world assets may offer an unprecedented opportunity to create new market infrastructure and drive efficiency in the trading of products across the globe.”

Canton is built on Daml, the smart contract language of Digital Asset, which creates an interoperable system where “assets, data, and cash” can synchronize across linked applications.

As the crypto winter shows signs of thawing, investment and industry interest continue from institutional investors.

In March, Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment bought up around $18 million in Coinbase shares, which equaled about 269,928 shares. A study from Goldman Sachs released on May 8 revealed that 32% of family offices currently have investments in digital assets.

On May 3, the securities token platform INX launched a new MPC wallet for institutional investors to control assets and employee access to such assets.

The Lightning Network (LN) is a federated system for cheap, near-instant payments built atop Bitcoin. When the Bitcoin mempool (where transactions waiting to be confirmed gather) is full or busy, the Lightning Network is unaffected.

Several large crypto exchanges have integrated the Lightning Network, including Bitfinex, River Financial, OKX, Kraken and CoinCorner. If implemented correctly, the Lightning Network would allow users to withdraw and send Bitcoin immediately from wallets, sidestepping the congested Bitcoin blockchain.

The largest crypto exchange in the United States, Coinbase, is also warming up to the LN. Further to comments that CEO Brian Armstrong would integrate the LN soon, Armstrong finally sent Cointelegraph reporter Joe Hall $100 over the Lightning Network, demonstrating that he is familiar with the layer-2 payments protocol.

European Bitcoin exchanges are also embracing the LN. Adem Bilican, the chief technology officer of Swiss-based Bitcoin exchange, Relai, told Cointelegraph:

“We believe that Bitcoin is the best savings technology ever invented. But you should be able to spend and send BTC as fast and cheaply as possible. The Lightning Network is the best solution to tackle that, no matter how the on-chain transaction fees look.”

Swiss Bitcoin exchange Pocket Bitcoin recently tweeted it would “get this Lightning thing started” in response to higher and higher fees on the Bitcoin base chain.

However, given that the LN is a relatively new solution in the crypto space, payment failure can occur. The network is growing and scaling organically, but more liquidity may help the network scale faster. Paolo Ardoino, chief technology officer of Bitfinex, shed light on the situation: 

“The Bitfinex node is the most interconnected node on the entire Lightning Network. It is also the biggest, providing liquidity to most of the other nodes. Hence the chances of failure are extremely low.“

True to form, Ardoino tweeted in response to the high fees that users should ask their crypto exchange to integrate LN. Binance and Coinbase are hopping on board, with other large exchanges Gemini, KuCoin and Bybit yet to announce implementing the LN.

While the interest in crypto investments was on the rise last year among home offices, 2023 saw a massive decline in investors’ certainty about the digital assets market. 

According to a Goldman Sachs report published on May 8 titled “Eyes on the Horizon: Family Office Investment Insights,” 32% of family offices currently hold investments in digital assets. This category includes cryptocurrencies, nonfungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain-focused funds.

Primary motivations of family offices to invest in digital assets. Source: Goldman Sachs 

Explaining their motivations for investing in digital assets, most (19%) cited a belief in the power of blockchain technology, with only 8% and 9% citing speculation and portfolio diversification, respectively.

Related: Concern over banking crisis reaches levels unseen since 2008 — Poll

The proportion of investments in cryptocurrencies among investors interested in digital finance has risen significantly since 2021, from 16% to 26%. However, the interest in potential investments in crypto has crashed this year, with just 12% of investors indicating it, down from 45% in 2021. As highlighted in the report:

“Opinions on cryptocurrencies seem to have crystallized: a greater proportion of family offices are now invested in cryptocurrencies, but the proportion that are not invested and not interested in investing in the future has grown more.”

The report is based on a survey conducted between January and February 2023 via questionnaires distributed to home offices by email. Overall, 166 home offices participated, 95 of which are based in the Americas, 34 in Europe and the Middle East, and 37 in the Asia Pacific.

Goldman Sachs appeared among the top winners during the recent banking crisis, with many investors deciding to rotate their portfolio investments. Goldman Sachs’ money funds have received $52 billion — a 13% growth — in the biggest monthly volume of inflows since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

Coinbase’s legal chief has requested the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) make several revisions to its proposed regulation on the responsibilities of registered investment advisers (RIAs) for storing client assets with qualified custodians.

Although the SEC acknowledges Coinbase Custody Trust Company as a “qualified custodian,“ Coinbase contends that the updated RIA custody rule unfairly targets crypto and makes improper assumptions about custodial practices based on securities. According to a May 8 letter from Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal, the proposed SEC rulemaking fails to safeguard other asset classes, such as cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase Custody Trust Company is recognized as a qualified custodian for RIA clients. This custodian is responsible for protecting client assets from potential threats such as bankruptcy and cyberattacks.

This letter advocates for expanding the custody obligations proposal to ensure that it remains adaptable to future investments and protects them appropriately.

An RIA is a company that advises clients on investments in securities and may handle their investment portfolios. These firms are registered with the SEC or state securities administrators, depending on the value of the assets under management.

In the letter addressed to the SEC, Grewal criticized the proposed rulemaking titled “Safeguarding Advisory Client Assets, Proposed Rule 223-1” as misguided. Grewal called for a revision to the proposal and staff guidance, highlighting the need to safeguard all asset classes, including crypto assets, which haven’t been classified as securities until now.

Grewal suggests several revisions to the rule to protect investors, including defining state trust companies and other state-regulated financial institutions as qualified custodians, a longstanding congressional and SEC policy. He also proposes allowing limited exposure to non-qualified custodians and removing the ban on RIA client trades on crypto exchanges, which are not qualified custodians.

The SEC is expected to comply with the court order and respond to Coinbase’s writ of mandamus this week. Coinbase filed a lawsuit in April 2022, requesting that the court compel the SEC to publicly disclose its stance on a petition submitted several months prior. In the petition, the exchange posed 50 specific questions about the regulatory treatment of certain digital assets.

To send and receive payments on the Lightning Network, users must first set up a Lightning wallet and fund it with Bitcoin. From there, they can create payment channels and start transacting. This article will guide users through the process, from setting up their Lightning wallet to making their first Lightning payment.

What is the Lightning Network

The Lightning Network (LN for short, or simply “Lightning”) is a decentralized system for instant, high-volume micropayments that prevents users from delegating custody of funds to trusted third parties. It is a layer-2 protocol — a computer network built on top of the Bitcoin base layer (layer 1), the actual blockchain. The Lightning Network uses the Bitcoin base layer’s high protection standards to secure the network.

Bitcoin is a payment system designed to be slow, and its transactions are finalized in as long as one hour; this is because Bitcoin assembles transactions into blocks spaced on average 10 minutes apart, and payments are considered secure after confirmation of six blocks, which is about one hour. This is not ideal for micropayments and smaller transfers that are typically inefficient due to high base-layer fees.

Imagine people waiting one hour to pay for a coffee or a train ticket when they scan their phone through the station gate. The high fees add up to make the whole payment process clunky, inefficient and too costly for everyday Bitcoin network transactions.

The Lightning Network solves these problems as one of the first implementations of a multi-party smart contract using Bitcoin’s built-in scripting. On the Lightning Network, payments are instant, atomic and are not recorded on the blockchain; therefore, they don't require block confirmations to finalize. Lightning can be used by retailers for their point-of-sale terminals, by individuals for device-to-device transactions such as remittance payments, or whenever instant payments are needed without the validation of third parties.

The Lightning Network allows users to quickly send and receive Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,757

 with virtually no or minimal fees while achieving a throughput (message delivery rate) of approximately 1 million transactions per second (TPS). Compared to Solana, with 65,000 TPS, or even Visa, which has the infrastructure to process around 24,000 TPS, the Lightning Network is by far the fastest payment method available.

To meet the increasing demand for Bitcoin payments and micropayments, the network will need to support a much higher volume of transactions, which would be impossible to scale on the layer-1 chain. This is why the Lightning Network is considered by many the solution to scale Bitcoin in a way that doesn’t affect its decentralization and without delegation of trust and ownership.

How to pay on the Lightning Network

Users need to get a Lightning Network-enabled Bitcoin wallet — where funds are placed into a two-party, multisignature “channel” Bitcoin address — to make Bitcoin Lightning Network payments. Understandably, the person or the business to be paid will also have a Bitcoin wallet with access to Lightning.

Most wallets are mobile due to a phone’s ease and frequency of performing instant payments. Examples of Bitcoin Lightning wallet apps include Muun, Wallet of Satoshi, Phoenix and Cash App, and they can be downloaded on both iOS and Android devices. Muun facilitates submarine swaps, a fast trade between on-chain and off-chain digital assets.

Submarine swap is a type of off-chain cryptocurrency transaction that allows for the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another. It uses the Lightning Network to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions. Phoenix (a non-custodial wallet) and Wallet of Satoshi provide nearly instantaneous safe payments with minimal fees.

Most wallets are non-custodial, meaning that the Bitcoin funds are under the custody of the owners only, and they have a multi-signature feature as an extra layer of protection for the private key.

By depositing BTC into a Lightning wallet, users open a channel, and that is their entry into the network. Even if it’s impossible to see, every time a user pays a new person or a new business with the Lightning Network, the user opens a channel with that counterparty.

This channel can be direct and created on purpose between two parties to transact easily. Alternatively, it can be a routing payment over Lightning, allowing Lightning transactions between two unconnected parties to use a series of pre-existing channels.

Once users establish a channel, they will access the entire network’s public channels, all stitched together and ready to route payments, with lightning nodes searching for the best route to perform the transaction. This is why when users pay a new retailer, they can do it instantly just by scanning the QR code, without having to open a direct channel.

Payments occur through a channel instantly, with near-zero fees, without going through Bitcoin’s base layer all the time.

Making a payment through the Lightning Network is as simple as any other digital payment method and can be done by following these steps:

Open the payer’s wallet on the Lightning page.
Click on “Send.”
Scan the merchant’s or an individual’s QR code button or enter the address manually.
Confirm everything is correct and proceed with the checkout.

Similarly, to receive Bitcoin with Lightning, the following steps may help:

Open your wallet on the Lightning page.
Click on “Receive.”
Scan your QR code button on the payer’s device or have the person enter the address manually.
Confirm everything is correct and proceed with the checkout.

The Lightning Network wallets may be suitable for keeping a small amount of Bitcoin for everyday expenses. However, it is important to note that manually entering a payment address on the Lightning Network can be error-prone and time-consuming. In contrast, scanning a QR code provides a more accurate and faster way of entering the payment address and, therefore, completing the transaction.

How to fund your Lightning Network wallet with BTC

In order to open a channel or process a payment, a user will need some BTC funds in the wallet. To upload Bitcoin to a wallet, here are the usual steps to follow:

You should set up your wallet to use the Bitcoin base chain (Bitcoin wallet) or the Lightning Network (Lightning wallet). Select the wallet network you want to use.
Go to “Receive” and click on it.
Check the transaction details are correct.
Scan the QR code or copy and paste the receiving address onto the wallet you’re getting your funds from.
You have the option to add an invoice for the payment. Click on the “Invoice” button to proceed.

Once you’ve received BTC and opened a channel, you can send and receive Bitcoin with no time or amount limits. The Lightning Network is still considered experimental and must be refined, and it is therefore recommended not to store a significant amount of BTC in a Lightning wallet.

Who runs the Lightning Network

The Lightning Network is an open-source project that was ideated by research scientists Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja in 2015. Starting as a way to address the significant increase in Bitcoin’s transaction fees, the project developed a new payment system built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. In January 2016, the duo published the white paper, and the project started gaining more traction among developers and investors.

The same year, Lightning Labs — the company developing and maintaining the Lightning Network — was co-founded by Elizabeth Stark. The organization released a beta version of the ecosystem for developers to test, highlighting the value that layer-2 solutions can bring to the greater ecosystem.

With increasing amounts of funding and interest around the Lightning Network, such an ecosystem is gaining growing traction among Bitcoin enthusiasts, especially in light of the Lightning Network smart contract set up, which may open opportunities in decentralized finance and other applications.

How to receive Bitcoin on the Cash App

To deposit Bitcoin into Cash App, Bitcoin withdrawals and deposits must be enabled within the app by taking the following steps:

Click on the “Money” tab on your Cash App home screen.
Select “Bitcoin.”
Click on “Deposit Bitcoin” to get started.
Copy your Bitcoin wallet address onto the sender’s relevant box.

A wallet’s unique address can be used to receive Bitcoin from a third party to your account and will change after each successful deposit to ensure more privacy. Users can deposit up to $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in any seven-day period. As transferring Bitcoin occurs in the base-layer chain, it may take hours for transfers to be confirmed.

How to use the Cash App Lightning Network

In October 2022, Cash App added the Lightning Network to the Bitcoin wallet to enable Bitcoin’s faster transactions with little to no fees. Here’s how to send BTC using the Cash App Lightning Network:

Click on the payments “$” tab on Cash App to view the home screen.
Select the QR scanner on the top left corner of the screen.
Hold your camera over the Lightning invoice QR code to scan it.
Follow the instructions to confirm and pay the request.

Similarly, the following steps illustrate how to receive Bitcoin using the Cash App Lightning Network:

Open Cash App and click on the Money tab.
Select “Bitcoin.”
Click on “Receive” Bitcoin.
Share the QR code or link with the sender and scan.

To receive Bitcoin with the Lightning Network, the sender doesn’t need a Cash App account to pay a user’s request, but the sender will need a Lightning-enabled Bitcoin wallet.

Moving funds with Lightning addresses (LNURLs)

The Lightning Network is gradually being adopted across the crypto community and service providers, including exchanges. Kraken was one of the first to implement Lightning in March 2022. Moreover, in April 2023, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced a Coinbase-Lightning Network partnership, meaning one of the most popular exchanges in the world will be adopting Bitcoin’s instant payment network soon.

In December 2022, Lightning addresses were added to the Lightning Network. A Lightning address is like an email address but for Bitcoin, a straightforward way for anyone to send Bitcoin instantly on the Lightning Network, ushering in a new standard for how value moves around the world.

LNURLs gained a lot of traction recently when Armstrong apparently failed to recognize the Lightning address of Cointelegraph journalist Joe Hall, missing a payment due to the writer and stirring some debate on Twitter. Lightning addresses are a crucial addition to Lightning payment services, even though they will take time to be fully adopted.

Warren Buffett moving into cash suggests he’s bracing for a possible collapse in risk-on asset prices. With Bitcoin 

BTC

 up 70% year-to-date and correlated with equities, should BTC investors also prepare for a potential stock market crash? 

Buffett says “incredible period” is over

Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway dumped $13.30 billion worth of equities and increased exposure in cash and United States Treasurys in Q1, its latest quarterly earnings report shows. Meanwhile, it channeled $4.4 billion toward purchasing its own stock and $2.9 billion on the shares of other publicly-traded companies.

The market considers Berkshire Hathaway’s performance as a key indicator to gauge the U.S. economy’s health, given the firm’s holdings range from American railroad to electric utilities and retail businesses.

But the 92-year-old investor, who has credited the U.S. economy’s growth for the success of Berkshire Hathaway in the past, is no longer optimistic.

“The majority of our businesses will report lower earnings this year than last year,” Buffett said last weekend at an event. The “incredible period” for the U.S. economy has been coming to an end over the past six months, he added.

Berkshire raised its cash reserves by $2 billion to $130.60 billion in Q1 2023, the highest level since the end of 2021 when equities entered a bear cycle. Moreover, the firm holds a vast amount of its cash in short-term Treasury bills and bank deposits, thanks to higher interest rates near 5%. 

In other words, Buffett is preparing for a potential stock market crash, particularly as the U.S. banking crisis unfolds, with shares of many banks, such as PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp, sinking.

Bitcoin price stays correlated with Nasdaq 

The increasing possibility of a global recession also risks putting downside pressure on Bitcoin, with its 100-week correlation with the Nasdaq reaching its highest level of about 0.42%.

Moreover, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone expects that BTC price would likely be the leading indicator for a stock crash. 

“Bitcoin could pace declines for risk assets — If the worst isn’t over for risk assets, Bitcoin may lead the way lower,” commented McGlone, adding:

“Bitcoin is up about 70% in 2023 to May 2 vs. 20% for the stock index, and those are maybe bounces within broader bear markets. The Fed [is] still tightening in May, and [is] more inclined to stay the course unless risk assets fall to ease inflation, may portend a lose-lose.“

In the short term, there are little expectations from the U.S. Consumer Price Index report on May 10 about easing inflation in April. According to Bloomberg’s survey, economists expect core CPI to remain unchanged at around 5%, suggesting more rate hikes are ahead.

On the other hand, a significant drop in inflation will likely prompt the Fed to consider pausing or even slashing interest rates in an extreme case scenario.

Currently, Fed funds futures’ data suggests that at least five rate cuts between May 2023 and January 2024 are likely, which may pour cold water on Buffett’s risk-off strategy.

Could Bitcoin price fall below $25K again?

Bitcoin’s price has declined roughly 6% over the past week, trading for as low as $27,350 on May 9.

Notably, this has pulled BTC’s price below its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave), near $27,950.

Bitcoin bears are now eyeing $27,000 as the next downside target based on the level’s recent history.

A decisive break below the $27,000 support, primarily in the event of further rate hikes, could then pull BTC/USD down to its 200-day EMA (the blue wave) near $24,600. In other words, a 10% drop by June. 

Conversely, a rebound from $27,000 increases the possibility of BTC price retesting $30,000 as resistance and resuming the uptrend of the last few months.

In the letter addressed to the SEC, Grewal criticized the proposed rulemaking titled “Safeguarding Advisory Client Assets, Proposed Rule 223-1” as misguided. Grewal called for a revision to the proposal and staff guidance, highlighting the need to safeguard all asset classes, including crypto assets, which haven’t been classified as securities until now.

Grewal suggests several revisions to the rule to protect investors, including defining state trust companies and other state-regulated financial institutions as qualified custodians, a longstanding congressional and SEC policy. He also proposes allowing limited exposure to non-qualified custodians and removing the ban on RIA client trades on crypto exchanges, which are not qualified custodians.

The SEC is expected to comply with the court order and respond to Coinbase’s writ of mandamus this week. Coinbase filed a lawsuit in April 2022, requesting that the court compel the SEC to publicly disclose its stance on a petition submitted several months prior. In the petition, the exchange posed 50 specific questions about the regulatory treatment of certain digital assets.

Bitcoin ordinals — also known as Bitcoin NFTs — have made their way into the limelight of the Web3 space, as more marketplaces continue to adopt and offer digital assets.

On May 9, the cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced that it will support Bitcoin ordinals on its NFT marketplace in late May. The development will expand Binance’s multichain NFT ecosystem to include the Bitcoin network.

Previously the Binance NFT market integrated with other decentralized networks, including BNB Chain, Ethereum and Polygon.

Mayur Kamat, the head of product at Binance, commented on broadening the offerings in the marketplace and Bitcoin’s

“Bitcoin is the OG of crypto.”

The update allows Binance users to purchase and trade Bitcoin ordinals from existing Binance accounts. According to the announcement, the update will also include royalty support and “additional revenue generating opportunities” for those creating Bitcoin ordinals.

Prior to Binance’s announcement, the cryptocurrency exchange OKX similarly announced in late April that it was bringing Bitcoin ordinals to its marketplace and wallet ecosystem. Initially, OKX users could view and store ordinals using their accounts, with the option to mint ordinals being hinted at in the future, according to Haider Rafique, the chief marketing officer at OKX.

The Bitcoin NFTs are also available on marketplaces such as Magic Eden, which integrated the feature back in March.

According to recent data, inscriptions of Bitcoin ordinals have been on the rise in recent months. On April 2, Bitcoin ordinals reached 58,179 inscriptions — up 83.5% from the previous month. However, on May 1, the total number of Bitcoin ordinal inscriptions skyrocketed to exceed 3 million.

Nonetheless, they remain a controversial topic within the crypto community, with Bitcoin maximalists criticizing them for deviating from Bitcoin’s original peer-to-peer ethos.

 network has witnessed another meteoric rise, almost doubling from 2.5 million to 4.78 million in just the last eight days. 

While the Ordinals protocol was initially used to mint images as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), users began to realize that they could use text-based inscriptions to create fungible tokens in a similar way to those minted via the ERC-20 token standard on the Ethereum (ETH) network.

These text-based inscriptions, now popularized as the BRC-20 token standard, have been the main cause of the massive uptick in Ordinals inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain.

As highlighted by Glassnode co-founder and chief technology officer Rafael Schultze-Kraft on Twitter, text-based inscriptions are now the most popular form of Ordinals inscription, with more than 2.8 million text-based inscriptions as of May 5.

More recent data from popular blockchain data hub Dune Analytics shows that since April 25, the overwhelming majority (99%) of all new Ordinals inscriptions have been text-based.

According to brc-20.io, a new tool that allows users to track BRC-20 tokens, there are currently a total of 14,200 new tokens hosted on the Bitcoin blockchain. Counted among the most popular Bitcoin-based tokens are “ordi”, “nals” and even a Bitcoin-based version of the now-notorious memecoin Pepe (PEPE) being listed at number 3 by total market cap.

The rise of Ordinals over the last few months has continued to spark debate around whether Ordinals are ultimately a positive for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Some Bitcoin proponents, such as Dan Held, claim that Ordinals offers a wider spread of financial use cases for Bitcoin, while more hardline Bitcoiners argue that Ordinals stray from the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, who intended for Bitcoin to be used as an electronic, peer-to-peer cash system.

Meanwhile, miners have enjoyed an enormous influx of revenue due to the transaction fees related to the burst of new activity on the network.

‘Unjustly enriched’ — Core Scientific knocks back $4.7M claim from Celsius

Core Scientific has rejected a multi-million-dollar administrative claim from Celsius Network, arguing it’s owed an even higher amount from the crypto lender.

$27,757

 mining firm Core Scientific has objected to paying a $4.7 million administrative claim put forward by crypto lender Celsius Network, leading to a battle between the firms over contractual obligations.

According to the objection filed in Texas bankruptcy court on May 5, Core Scientific has asked that Celsius Network’s $4.7 million administrative claims be rejected as the firm cannot prove it is entitled to one.

“Celsius’ request for allowance and immediate payment of the Celsius alleged admin claim ignores that Core has substantial claims against Celsius, which Core believes exceed the Celsius alleged admin claim,” wrote the objection.

For context, Core first signed a contract with Celsius in 2020 to host its cryptocurrency holdings in Core’s data centers. However, due to an increase in the price of power, Core passed these additional costs on to Celsius, an allowance that was reportedly stipulated in the original contract.

Despite Celsius initially paying these costs, the crypto lender ceased payments after it filed bankruptcy, Core Scientific claimed in the objection.

“If anyone has been unjustly enriched here, it is Celsius,” Core Scientific wrote in the objection. According to the now-defunct Bitcoin miner, Celsius has been “sitting on almost $8 million of money it owes to Core” due to a “blatant post-petition violation” of the agreed-upon dispute resolution mechanism.

Celsius now owes Core Scientific a total of approximately $11 million, a sum that accrues an additional $28,000 in fees and interest with each passing day, the Bitcoin mining firm’s lawyers argued.

The conflict between the two firms has been raging since Oct. 19, when Core Scientific first accused Celsius of failing to pay its power bills, citing the non-payments as a significant factor in the liquidity issues that led to the embattled Bitcoin miner filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Dec. 21.

“The millions of dollars Celsius shortchanged Core after Celsius’s bankruptcy filing plus the millions of dollars in litigation…significantly contributed to Core’s liquidity drain and eventual chapter 11 filing.”

On Dec. 28, Core Scientific filed a motion seeking approval to reject Celsius’ contracts, claiming the firm’s failure to pay its power bills constituted a material breach of contract. On Jan. 3, Celsius agreed to let Core Scientific shut down more than 37,000 Bitcoin mining rigs that the miner was hosting for the crypto lender.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

Estonia squeezes out 400 crypto firms after new laws

Estonia’s money laundering regulator highlighted a number of issues it found within local crypto firms, such as dodgy execs and nonsensical business plans.

Almost 400 virtual asset service providers (VASPS) have voluntarily shut down or had their authorizations revoked in Estonia following the government’s recently enhanced Terrorist Financing Prevention and Anti-Money Laundering laws (AML) that came into effect in March.

The amended laws expanded the defined scope of VASPs, required firms to have legitimate links to Estonia, increased licensing fees, and capital and information reporting requirements, along with introducing the Financial Action Task Force Travel Rule.

According to a May 8 statement from the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the amendment to the AML laws on March 15 has since seen almost 200 domestic crypto service providers voluntarily shut down.

Source: Republic of Estonia Financial Intelligence Unit

Another 189 also had their authorizations revoked due to “non-compliance with the requirements.”

“Given the documents submitted by the service providers that have lost their authorizations, and their methods of operation and the risks involved, it can be argued that the legislator’s response with regard to the amendments to the Act, and the supervision activities both before and after the amendments, have been relevant,” noted Matis Mäeker, the director of the Financial Intelligence Unit, adding:

“In renewing authorisations, we saw situations that would surprise every supervisor.”

Following the hefty clear-out, there were 100 active crypto firms registered in Estonia as of May 1, according to the FIU.

The FIU highlighted a number of general issues it found within the companies it forcibly shut down, particularly relating to misleading company information.

To name a few examples, some companies had registered board members and company contacts unbeknownst to the actual individuals themselves. Other companies had a number of people on the books who had falsified professional backgrounds on their resumes.

It also appears that many companies had copy and pasted identical business plans from each other, which were also found to be lacking “any logic or connection with Estonia.”

Estonia has made a considered effort to enact strong AML laws across the board over the past few years. This is primarily due to the discovery in 2018 that around $235 billion worth of illicit capital had been laundered through the Estonian branch of Denmark megabank Danske Bank.

The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has also had an impact, as Estonia has pushed to “cut off revenues supporting Russia’s war machine and protect international financial systems,” via strong AML regulation as part of its partnership with the U.S.

Another factor that likely has contributed to the recently enhanced AML laws is its membership in the European Union, therefore meaning it will soon have to implement the upcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) laws that are slated to come into effect in early 2025.

Under MiCA, crypto firms will be subject to stringent AML and terrorism prevention requirements.

For the past 17 days, the Bitcoin price has been trading within a narrow 8.5% range, from $27,250 to $29,550, causing the 40-day volatility metric to drop below 40%. This wasn’t restricted to cryptocurrencies, as the S&P 500 index’s historical volatility reached 17%, its lowest level since December 2021.

But will $28,000 become the new resistance? Not according to the latest Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,757

 futures and options data. Nevertheless, macroeconomic conditions remain the main driver for risk markets’ price fluctuations in the near to medium terms.

BTC price flattens as investors lose risk appetite

A myriad of reasons could be given to explain the relatively small price oscillations in risk markets, including the expectation of a recession, investors unwilling to place new bets until the United States Federal Reserve ends its rate hikes, or increased demand (and focus) on fixed-income trades.

The problem is that no one can prove what has been causing investors to restrict their risk appetite and drive Bitcoin’s price sideways. Many — including Warren Buffett, the multi-billionaire fund manager — fear that commercial real estate is a growing concern, which could trigger major turbulence ahead.

While some believe that the U.S. debt ceiling discussion and the banking crisis could further cement the U.S. dollar’s weakening, Buffett does not foresee alternatives. The finance mogul is a long-term critic of the precious metal gold, as his investment thesis prioritizes yield-providing assets.

The debt ceiling drama has caused Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to warn that a “steep economic downturn” would follow if Congress fails to act in the next few weeks.

On the one hand, the government is facing pressure to sustain economic activity and contain the banking crisis. Ultimately, increasing the debt limit would add liquidity to the markets, further triggering inflation.

This complex environment of inflation risks, an economic downturn and a weakening U.S. dollar might have caused investors to lose interest in risk assets and concentrate their bets on fixed-income trades as interest rates have moved above 5% per year.

For Bitcoin, an alarming sign would be a negative futures contract premium or increased costs for hedging using options. That’s why investors should closely track those BTC derivatives metrics.

Bitcoin futures display weak demand from longs

Bitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.

As a result, BTC futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium — a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.

Bitcoin traders have been extremely cautious in the past two weeks. Even during the recent rally toward $29,850 on May 6, there was no surge in demand for leverage longs. Moreover, the subsequent 6.8% correction down to $27,800 has brought the BTC futures premium to its lowest level in two months at 1.5%.

Bitcoin options risk metric stood neutral

Traders should also analyze options markets to understand whether the recent correction has caused investors to become more optimistic. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.

In short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a negative 7% skew.

As displayed above, the options 25% delta skew has recently flirted with excessive optimism, as the protective put options were trading at a 7% discount on May 7 relative to similar neutral-to-bullish call options.

Still, the trend quickly reverted, as the Bitcoin price tested levels below $28,000. Currently, this is a balanced risk appetite according to BTC options pricing, as the 25% delta skew indicator stands near 0%.

Bitcoin options and futures markets suggest that pro traders are less confident, favoring sideways trading. Thus, traders should not flip bearish due to weakening derivatives indicators.

In other words, if there was enough conviction that $28,000 would become resistance, one would expect a much higher appetite for risk-averse put options and a negative BTC futures premium, or “backwardation.""

Risch, who also serves as finance minister, is quoted as saying:

However, he did not give a timeframe. Moreover, the principality is unlikely to accept Bitcoin and “hodl” (hold onto) the satoshis it receives. Instead, it will accept deposits in Bitcoin and immediately exchange them for Swiss francs, the national currency. The direct exchange into fiat money sidesteps the currency’s volatility.

Despite not being a European Union member, Liechtenstein is part of the European Economic Area, where the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation could apply. This regulatory clarity could attract more crypto firms to the region.

Similar to Gibraltar and the Isle of Man, Lichtenstein is a small but thriving cryptocurrency hub in Europe. The Liechtenstein Blockchain Act, which passed in 2019, provided clear crypto regulation, with several crypto-focused businesses setting up operations in the country since.

The nation follows a similar course to the nearby Swiss communities of Zug and Lugano, which accept Bitcoin for some taxes and public services, with retailers, including the likes of McDonald’s, also accepting BTC.

Nonetheless, the sixth smallest nation in the world is cautious in its approach to investing in Bitcoin or crypto. Risch expressed that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are currently too risky for the country’s multibillion-dollar treasury, but the verdict may change in the future.

Binance ""FUD"" drags Bitcoin down

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows Bitcoin trading below $28,000 into the May 8 Wall Street open.

The largest cryptocurrency continues to experience a dip in sentiment after transaction fees hit their highest levels ever and the mempool became almost 98% full.

Mass transactions ""spamming"" the Bitcoin network lies at the center of the problem, market participants believe. The impact was worsened, however, by largest global exchange Binance repeatedly halting BTC withdrawals.

Blaming ""congestion"" for the outages, Binance created a backlog of withdrawals, which served to worsen already nervous market sentiment. A subsequent tweet confirmed that the backlog had been cleared.

BTC/USD nonetheless stayed suppressed, the day's lows standing at $27,617 at the time of writing and corresponding to a drop of 7.4% versus local highs seen over the weekend.

, matched Bitcoin's 24-hour losses, down around 2.4% to trade near $315.

Whether supportive or not, traders were quick to agree with Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, when the latter called the market reaction to the withdrawal pauses ""FUD."" 

""Apparently, Bitcoin doesn't work again. Best sell it all and move on,"" Filbfilb, CEO of trading suite Decentrader, joked.

It is not the first time that Binance has found itself at the center of BTC price controversy. In late March, other news, likewise labeled ""FUD"" by Zhao, produced similar effects.

Watch these BTC price support levels

With that, Bitcoin traders are beginning to eye potential targets for a long entry amid an extended downtrend.

Michaël van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight, set his sights on $27,400 and $26,800, respectively.

""Mentioned before that $29.2K was the key level to break for Bitcoin. We did have a bounce towards it, but no break. Additionally some FUD regarding Binance, doesn't help,"" part of a tweet stated.

Van de Poppe noted that the difference in weekend open and close price had created a ""gap"" in CME Group Bitcoin futures markets, with the implication that an uptick may now ensue to ""fill it"" in classic style.

Others eyed targets closer to spot, including popular trader CrypNuevo.

""Still ranging in this $27-30K region. Now trading back below the mid-range again,"" Daan Crypto Trades meanwhile continued.

""No trade zone on BTC for me until we see a proper break or sweep of either of these range extremes.""

Human ID project ‘Worldcoin’ launches gas-free wallet only for humans

The wallet relies on “World ID,” a protocol that verifies humanness through zero-knowledge proofs.

Worldcoin, a project to identify humans and distinguish them from artificial intelligence, has launched a gas-free crypto wallet for verified humans, according to a May 8 announcement. 

The new wallet, called “World App,” works on Android and iOS operating systems. It currently runs on the Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8796

 network, allowing users to hold and transfer United States Dollar Coin 

USDC

$1.00

, Dai (DAI), Ether 

ETH

$1,854

, Worldcoin (WLD) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).

World App uses the project’s “World ID” system to discriminate between humans and bots. Users who want to take advantage of gas-free transfers must first register for a World ID by supplying a phone number or iris scan. Developers say the project doesn’t store users’ data. Instead, it generates a zero-knowledge proof to verify the user is human, but without revealing the data used to generate the proof.

Even users who don’t have a World ID can still use the app, but they can’t take advantage of the feeless transactions. The announcement said the app relies on account abstraction to allow for third-party gas payment.

The project has partnered with regulated crypto exchanges, including Moonpay and Ramp, to offer onboarding and offboarding within the wallet. Once coins are held in the wallet, they can be swapped through built-in Uniswap integration. Users can also connect their phone numbers to the app to send and receive crypto through phone contacts.

In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Worldcoin Core team member Tiago Sada stated that the wallet was created to offer a simple option for inexperienced crypto users.

“When we first started, we actually just went out with normal wallets, the wallets a power user like me would use day-to-day, and it turns out those were too overwhelming for normal people. There were too many options, too many things to do, [it was] not super clear,"" he said. ""We’re launching [World App] as a product so that there is this alternative wallet that is focused just on simplicity.”

Worldcoin was co-founded by Sam Altman, who also co-founded ChatGPT developer OpenAI.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

Bitcoin options: Bracing for volatility

Traditional market analysts have started calling for a volatility spike due to the United States government debt discussion.

Moreover, signs of stress coming from the banking sector surprised investors after the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, reached its lowest level in 12 months at 101 on May 4.

Stock market and macro analyst Markets & Mayhem posted a chart from Deutsche Bank that correlates historical government spending and debt concerns with spikes in the stock market volatility.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the government may run out of cash by June if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling. According to the BBC, President Joe Biden has called a meeting of congressional leaders on the issue for May 9.

Government officials said the overspending is partly due to lower-than-expected income tax receipts, which are typical of recession periods.

Volatility could impact Bitcoin price, but direction unknown

It is worth noting that the volatility indicator neither dictates whether the market has been gaining strength nor anticipates eventual crashes.

The index calculation does not account for price gains or losses, only directional changes. Thus, if the volatility reaches historically low levels, it merely reflects that the asset has displayed a low amplitude of daily price fluctuations.

Bitcoin’s 40-day historical volatility does not usually remain below 40% for long. That information, coupled with the traditional markets’ stress caused by the regional banking crisis and the debt ceiling discussion, might be brewing the perfect storm for a sharp volatility spike.

While one can benefit from the expectation of higher volatility for the next couple of weeks, most investors are unwilling to take directional bets, meaning they have no confidence in whether the market will move up or down.

However, there is an options strategy that fits this scenario and allows investors to profit from a strong move on either side.

The reverse (short) iron butterfly is a limited-risk, limited-profit options trading strategy. It’s important to remember that options have a set expiration date, meaning the price change must happen during the defined period.

Profit/Loss estimate. Source: Deribit Position Builder

The option prices above were taken on May 5, with Bitcoin trading at $29,172. All options listed are for the June 30 expiry, but this strategy can also be used using a different time frame.

The suggested non-directional strategy consists of selling 9.2 BTC contracts of the $26,000 put options while selling 12.2 call options with a $33,000 strike. To finalize the trade, one should buy 13.5 contracts of $30,000 call options and another eight contracts of $30,000 put options.

While this call option gives the buyer the right to acquire an asset, the contract seller gets a (potential) negative exposure. To fully protect from market oscillations, one must deposit 0.90 BTC (roughly $26,250), representing the investors’ maximum loss.

Conviction is essential, as the risk-reward ratio is reversed

For this investor to profit, one needs Bitcoin’s price to be below $27,000 on June 30 (down 7.5%) or above $32,150 (up 10.2%). The trade has a hugely profitable area but loses over twice the potential gain if Bitcoin fails to move either way considerably.

The maximum payout is 0.337 BTC (roughly $9,830), but if a trader is confident that volatility is right around the corner, a 10% move in 55 days seems quite feasible.

The investor can revert the operation before the options expiry, preferably after a strong Bitcoin price move. All one needs to do is buy back the two options that have been sold and sell the other two that were previously bought.

Defending against SEC to cost Ripple $200M, CEO Brad Garlinghouse says

Ripple’s CEO reveals $200 million spent defending the SEC lawsuit, and laments about U.S. crypto regulation and a politics-first policy, advising entrepreneurs to avoid the United States.

Ripple has spent $200 million defending the case brought against it by the United States Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), according to CEO Brad Garlinghouse. 

Garlinghouse dropped the figure during a fireside chat at the Dubai Fintech Summit on May 8. He stated that the U.S. is stuck compared with the regulatory progress of the United Arab Emirates virtual asset regulatory authority and the recent Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA) bill in the European Union. He went on to share that by the time the case is decided, Ripple will have spent $200 million defending itself against a lawsuit which, from its very beginning, doesn’t make a lot of sense.

In a message to SEC chair Gary Gensler, Garlinghouse expressed regret about the U.S. falling behind significantly as Ripple expands to the United Arab Emirates. According to him, the tough thing about the situation is having a country that has put politics ahead of policy. Garlinghouse said one of the first pieces of advice he gives entrepreneurs when they ask him about getting something started is,” If I were you, I would not start in the United States.” He believes many U.S.-based companies and U.S. public companies would agree.

When asked about the U.S. needing a clear regulatory framework for crypto, Garlinghouse said the SEC must understand that the vast majority of people working in crypto and blockchain are good actors who want to stay within the rules of the road but need them defined.

The case has been going on for two and a half years and has created headwinds in the U.S. market. A decision is expected from the judge sometime in the next three to six months, according to Garlinghouse.

Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,812

 starts a new week at the center of new crypto industry drama as the highest fees in two years pressure price action.

Downside volatility is greeting traders thanks to a full mempool, and explanations point the finger at multiple parties.

The largest exchange, Binance, is adding to the confusion, pausing BTC withdrawals several times over what it calls network “congestion.”

Amid the turmoil, BTC/USD is showing signs of strain, breaking down from $28,000 to threaten an exit of its broader trading range.

The events mark a flustered start to a week full of potential BTC price volatility catalysts. These come in the form of macroeconomic data releases, including the Consumer Price Index and Q1 earnings reports.

As Bitcoin network metrics show the impact of current network activity, data shows miners are still selling their holdings, leading analysts to conclude that the 2022 bear market is still in play.

Cointelegraph looks at these factors and more in the weekly rundown of what’s moving crypto markets.

Binance CEO calls “FUD” amid BTC withdrawal suspensions

Bitcoin is under pressure at the start of the week, but not for the usual reasons.

As BTC/USD dips to $28,000, observers closely follow events on-chain and at the largest global exchange, Binance.

The latter has halted BTC withdrawals three times since the weekend, citing “congestion” on the Bitcoin network, while simultaneously moving a giant chunk of funds between wallets.

Binance’s moves came as large numbers of transactions entered the Bitcoin mempool, pushing already high fees even further into territory not seen in several years.

That had the unintended result of creating Bitcoin’s first-ever block in which miners earned more from fees than the block subsidy itself — 6.75 BTC versus 6.25 BTC, respectively.

Attention focused on Ordinals and even crypto investment giant Digital Currency Group as the source of the transactions. Later, market participants, including researcher and investor Eric Wall, revealed a potential source of the on-chain “spamming.”

Meanwhile, Binance came in for criticism from some of the industry’s best-known names over its policy.

“Bitcoin is not experiencing congestion. It’s experiencing high demand,” core developer Peter Todd argued.

“binance can just allow users to specify what fee their willing to pay for withdraw, and pay that fee. It costs ~$5 to get an output in the next block. nbd Good chance @binance has a fractional reserve.”

Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao indirectly referred to “BTC withdrawal issues” at the exchange, labeling them “FUD.”

Traders eye key levels as BTC price hits 2-week lows

Beyond the immediate events surrounding Binance and fees, market participants continue to eye important levels for BTC/USD.

As the pair trends below $28,000, popular trader Captain Faibik is eyeing $27,300 as a line in the sand.

A further tweet on the day highlighted a tightening wedge structure in place for Bitcoin, with the logical outcome in the form of a breakout now due.

Fellow trader Andrew bet on the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) as a potential support zone, which currently resides near $27,950 and has already been violated on shorter timeframes.

CPI “good candidate” for risk-on rally

Turning to macroeconomic events, the week is set to be marked by the April print of the United States Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Due on May 10, the CPI will be keenly scrutinized for signs that inflation is continuing to decrease, potentially increasing the scope for lawmakers to ease economic policy.

In April, a slight dip below market expectations accompanied Bitcoin gunning for new ten-month highs.

However, the CPI is just one of several important U.S. data sets due this week, with jobless claims and Producer Price Index numbers set for release.

Four Federal Reserve speakers will take to the stage, while the week marks the last of the Q1 earnings reports by major corporations.

“Numbers are expected to be ‘Good looking,’ good numbers are expected by market and partly priced in,” crypto trading and analysis account Doctor Profit told Twitter followers about the CPI in part of weekly updates.

The CPI is known as a volatility catalyst across crypto, but this month, not everyone is predicting upside continuation, even in the event of positive numbers.

Among them is popular trader Aqua, who revealed a broader correction inbound for BTC/USD thanks to what he fears is “distribution” or tactical selling.

NVT underscores overheated network

The upheaval caused by high fees is already having an impact on long-term Bitcoin metrics.

Among them is the network value to transaction (NVT) ratio, which hit its highest level in four years on May 8.

As confirmed by on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, NVT is now at levels not seen since 2019.

Created by statistician Willy Woo, the NVT ratio measures the relationship between value moved on-chain and Bitcoin’s overall market cap.

“When Bitcoin’s NVT is high, it indicates that its network valuation is outstripping the value being transmitted on its payment network, this can happen when the network is in high growth and investors are valuing it as a high return investment, or alternatively when the price is in an unsustainable bubble,” Woo explains on his own data website, Woobull.

Cointelegraph has extensively covered both the NVT ratio and its follow-up NVT signal metric, the latter containing important nuances which influence how NVT data is interpreted.

Bitcoin miners still reducing BTC holdings

In a signal that Bitcoin miners continue to deal with the consequences of the 2022 bear market, their BTC reserves are at two-year lows.

As noted by on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the amount of BTC in miners’ wallets is still trending downward, despite the recovery in BTC price seen through 2023.

“The return of miners’ interest in holding bitcoins for a longer time will be one of the other valuable factors for the growth of the price counties, which is necessary to be attention to in the coming days on the market,” contributor Crazzyblockk wrote in one of CryptoQuant’s quicktake market updates on May 1.

Miners currently hold 1,826,695 BTC as of May 8, the least since July 2021.

As Cointelegraph reported, miners faced considerable pressure during 2022, as BTC/USD fell to risk their cost basis outstripping any revenue earned by mining.

Last week, separate numbers revealed that since 2010, miner revenues have totaled over $50 billion.

China is developing AI without US chips — Here’s how

U.S. sanctions have limited China’s access to the latest chip technology to develop AI, but local companies are not letting this stop them.

The race to develop artificial intelligence (AI) continues as China pushes forward the development of home-grown AI without utilizing the latest technology from the United States due to current sanctions. 

According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, Chinese companies are studying methods to develop AI via weaker semiconductors and combinations of chips to bypass reliance on a single type of hardware. 

The report said researchers and analysts believe creating alternatives to such chips will be difficult for Chinese tech firms, but some experiments have shown “promise.”

Sanctions imposed by the U.S. against China in October 2022 have deprived Chinese companies of accessing the most advanced chips on the market. This includes Nvidia’s A100 chips and the latest version, the H100, which are the most popular options in AI development.

Currently, the Chinese market has access to Nvidia chips A800 and H800, which can only support small-scale AI models.

In April, the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba announced it would roll out a ChatGPT competitor in the “near future” called Tongyi Qianwen. Alibaba plans to integrate the chatbot within its suite of applications, including its workplace messenger DingTalk.

ChatGPT is the brainchild of the U.S.-based company OpenAI. However, the race to create the best and most powerful AI system is underway, even among local American companies.

Microsoft recently released various new AI-powered features for its preexisting chatbot and web browser Edge, which are said to rival ChatGPT. Additionally, Google’s AI division DeepMind is said to be restructuring to deliver the latest AI breakthroughs.

Chinese authorities announced an upcoming mandatory review of all generative AI services released within the country before they can operate publicly.

Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,812

 starts a new week at the center of new crypto industry drama as the highest fees in two years pressure price action.

Downside volatility is greeting traders thanks to a full mempool, and explanations point the finger at multiple parties.

The largest exchange, Binance, is adding to the confusion, pausing BTC withdrawals several times over what it calls network “congestion.”

Amid the turmoil, BTC/USD is showing signs of strain, breaking down from $28,000 to threaten an exit of its broader trading range.

The events mark a flustered start to a week full of potential BTC price volatility catalysts. These come in the form of macroeconomic data releases, including the Consumer Price Index and Q1 earnings reports.

As Bitcoin network metrics show the impact of current network activity, data shows miners are still selling their holdings, leading analysts to conclude that the 2022 bear market is still in play.

Cointelegraph looks at these factors and more in the weekly rundown of what’s moving crypto markets.

Binance CEO calls “FUD” amid BTC withdrawal suspensions

Bitcoin is under pressure at the start of the week, but not for the usual reasons.

As BTC/USD dips to $28,000, observers closely follow events on-chain and at the largest global exchange, Binance.

The latter has halted BTC withdrawals three times since the weekend, citing “congestion” on the Bitcoin network, while simultaneously moving a giant chunk of funds between wallets.

Binance’s moves came as large numbers of transactions entered the Bitcoin mempool, pushing already high fees even further into territory not seen in several years.

That had the unintended result of creating Bitcoin’s first-ever block in which miners earned more from fees than the block subsidy itself — 6.75 BTC versus 6.25 BTC, respectively.

Attention focused on Ordinals and even crypto investment giant Digital Currency Group as the source of the transactions. Later, market participants, including researcher and investor Eric Wall, revealed a potential source of the on-chain “spamming.”

Meanwhile, Binance came in for criticism from some of the industry’s best-known names over its policy.

“Bitcoin is not experiencing congestion. It’s experiencing high demand,” core developer Peter Todd argued.

“binance can just allow users to specify what fee their willing to pay for withdraw, and pay that fee. It costs ~$5 to get an output in the next block. nbd Good chance @binance has a fractional reserve.”

Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao indirectly referred to “BTC withdrawal issues” at the exchange, labeling them “FUD.”

“Bitcoin network fees are fluctuating, 18x in a month,” part of a tweet stated.

As the events unfolded, BTC price action felt the strain, with a short timeframe downtrend continuing at the time of writing.

Analyzing trader behavior, monitoring resource Skew noted bid activity increasing on Binance as Bitcoin returned to the $28,000 mark.

Traders eye key levels as BTC price hits 2-week lows

Beyond the immediate events surrounding Binance and fees, market participants continue to eye important levels for BTC/USD.

As the pair trends below $28,000, popular trader Captain Faibik is eyeing $27,300 as a line in the sand.

A further tweet on the day highlighted a tightening wedge structure in place for Bitcoin, with the logical outcome in the form of a breakout now due.

Fellow trader Andrew bet on the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) as a potential support zone, which currently resides near $27,950 and has already been violated on shorter timeframes.

The day’s current low of $27,617 marked Bitcoin’s deepest dip since April 26, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView.

A sudden spike in Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,812

 transaction fees and unconfirmed transactions sparked concern on Crypto Twitter over the weekend of a potential Denial of Service (DoS) “attack” on the network.

Some Bitcoin analysts and commentators have been quick to allay these fears from their respective followers.

Bitcoin average transaction fees are currently $19.20, or 0.00068 BTC, according to BitInfoCharts. Meanwhile, according to Mempool Space, the backlog of transactions at time of writing stood at 459,341.

The increased demand on the network has even caused total fees per block to temporarily exceed the block subsidy reward of 6.25 BTC on May 7.

The proof-of-work mining process has a set block subsidy of 6.25 BTC, which halves every four years. However, in the rare instance that block space demand surges, this figure can be exceeded, causing higher transaction fees.

Industry analysts reported that it is the first time this has happened since 2017. Fees of 6.76 BTC were recorded for one block and block 788695 generated fees of 6.7 BTC.

The Mempool Space explorer shows that activity has since cooled down a little and fees have fallen back below the block reward again. The next block is expected to be processed generating 4.51 BTC in fees.

The surge in activity and block space demand has been attributed to the rise in Ordinals inscriptions. According to analytics provider Glassnode, a total of 75% of Bitcoin on-chain transactions used Taproot on May 7, resulting in a record high.

Some on Crypto Twitter, however, speculated that the recent congestion has resulted from a DoS (denial of service) attack on the Bitcoin network.

Bitcoin analysts quickly pointed out that it was due to demand rather than a premeditated attack. “0xfoobar” told his 130,000 followers:

“Bitcoin mempool finally gets some usage and the maxis are framing it as a DoS attack on the network. They really have not considered even the most basic scenarios, like ‘Bitcoin becomes popular and people are willing to pay to use it’”

On May 8, the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, suspended Bitcoin transactions again, citing “the large volume of pending transactions.” It is the second time that Binance has suspended BTC transactions in the past 12 hours.

Crypto exchange Binance halted Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,812

 withdrawals for the second time on May 8, citing a large backlog of pending withdrawals.

Binance tweeted on May 8 that it closed off BTC withdrawals “temporarily” as there was a “large volume of pending transactions.”

It added the transactions were still pending, as its “set fees did not anticipate the recent surge in [Bitcoin] network gas fees.”

There is a large volume of withdrawal transactions from Binance still pending as our set fees did not anticipate the recent surge in $BTC network gas fees.

Our team is working to accelerate the confirmation of all pending transactions.

We'll provide updates here.

— Binance (@binance) May 8, 2023

The exchange provided an update almost two hours after its initial tweet and said it was ""replacing the pending [Bitcoin] withdrawal transactions with a higher fee so that they get picked up by mining pools.""

Nearly three hours after it's first tweet, Binance said Bitcoin withdrawals had resumed with pending transactions being processed with higher transaction fees.

It added it was working on enabling withdrawals via the Lightning Network which it claimed could help mitigate such withdrawal halts in the future.

To prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed.

Our team has also been working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations.

— Binance (@binance) May 8, 2023

Earlier on May 7, Binance also had to temporarily suspend Bitcoin withdrawals, claiming there was an overflow of transactions on the blockchain. It reopened withdrawals over an hour and a half later.

At the time, the Bitcoin mempool had a backlog of around 400,000 transactions waiting to be processed. That swelled to nearly 485,000 at the time of Binance's second withdrawal halt, according to data from mempool.space.

A mempool is an area where transactions on the Bitcoin network “wait” before being verified by each blockchain node.

Binance saw significant Bitcoin net negative outflows on May 7 with around 175,650 BTC worth around $4.95 billion flowing from the exchange on the day according to data from CryptoQuant.

Binance claimed this outflow data was actually it moving Bitcoin between its hot and cold wallets.

The price of Bitcoin has also fallen around 3.5% from its weekly high of over $29,700 on May 6, as per Cointelegraph data.

Crypto-friendly Hong Kong is still gung-ho about giving its citizens access to crypto trading despite other jurisdictions “taking a step back,” claims the chair of the FinTech Association of Hong Kong (FTAHK).

Speaking to Cointelegraph at the Hong Kong WOW Summit in March, FTAHK chair Neil Tan said while Singapore and the United States are seemingly stepping back from permitting crypto retail trading, “Hong Kong is stepping forward.”

On June 1, a licensing regime for crypto exchanges will come into effect, and Tan said it’s “going to also include retail.” The licensing guidelines are expected to be released sometime in May.

“If there’s access to [crypto] in a legal and regulated way, then I'm sure participants will come. It is a ‘build it and they will come’ because there are no other options. The options are dwindling, actually.”

In February, the region’s securities regulator proposed allowing retail traders access licensed crypto platforms in its licensing regime proposals for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).

It noted that denying access could push traders to unregulated overseas platforms. Currently, these platforms can only serve accredited professional investors.

In January, Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) CEO Julia Leung Fung-yee said that retail traders would be limited to “highly liquid” digital assets but did not give any further details.

Along with providing what many consider to be an attractive legal framework for crypto, Hong Kong is also focusing efforts on attracting talent and infrastructure providers — what Tan called “the back end.”

He added both the Chinese and Hong Kong governments recognize the opportunities in the region and are taking action to try to support inbound talent.

“There's a lot of talent across the border and right now there's a fair amount of unemployment,” Tan said on China. “There's a lot of talent that's coming from Big Tech and so forth that's able to come into Hong Kong.”

Infrastructure to support crypto also needs to be in place for Hong Kong to realize its virtual asset hub ambitions, Tan said. “When the platforms come, they come with that infrastructure. They bring the infrastructure with them as well to deliver the product,” he added.

He added the opening of the financial industry to digital assets was “just a natural progression” as cryptocurrencies “become a little bit more prominent.”

“People are actually adopting [crypto] inside of their portfolios. Whether you're talking about the retail side, high net worth or institutional investors, everyone's looking at their portfolios and trying to get that type of exposure.”

“Now we're back in business. We're opening it up.”

Bitcoin’s 

BTC

$27,809

 volatility has shrunk further this week, and it is on track to form an inside-bar pattern on the weekly chart. Although the bulls are finding it difficult to clear the overhead hurdle in the $30,000 to $31,000 zone, a positive sign is that they have not ceded ground to the bears.

It is not only cryptocurrencies; even the S&P 500 Index has been oscillating inside a range for the past few days. This indicates that markets are awaiting a trigger to start the next directional move.

While the short-term price action is uncertain, analysts are getting bullish for the long term. Trader Titan of Crypto highlighted a potential signal on the Bollinger Bands monthly chart, which projects a rally to $63,500 in about a year.

While most major cryptocurrencies gave up some ground over the past week, there are still some pockets of strength. Let’s analyze the charts of five cryptocurrencies that may turn up in the short term.

Bitcoin price analysis

Bitcoin turned down sharply from the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on May 6, indicating that the bears are not willing to let the bulls through. A minor positive is that the bulls have been buying the dips to the support line of the triangle, as seen from the long tail on the day’s candlestick.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The flattish 20-day exponential moving average ($28,819) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint do not signal a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.

If the price breaks below the triangle, it will suggest that bears are trying to seize control. The BTC/USDT pair may first fall to $26,942 and then to $25,250.

On the other hand, a break and close above the triangle will suggest that the bulls have absorbed the supply. That may start a rally to $32,400 where the bears are again expected to mount a strong defense.

Buyers nudged the price above the triangle but the long wick on the candlestick shows that the breakout turned out to be a bull trap in the near term. BTC price turned down sharply and plunged to the support line of the triangle.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

The bounce off this level has reached the moving averages, which is a key short-term level to watch out for. If Bitcoin’s price turns down from the current level, that would raise the chances of a break below the support line.

Contrarily, if buyers kick the price above the moving averages, the pair may rise to the resistance line. The bulls will have to drive and sustain the price above this level to start an up-move.

Ether price analysis

Ether 

ETH

$1,859

 faced a strong rejection above the psychological resistance at $2,000 on May 7. This indicates that the bears have not given up and they continue to protect the overhead resistance levels.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($1,903) has flattened out and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating that the ETH/USDT pair may remain range-bound in the near term. The boundaries of the range could be between $2,000 and $1,785.

A consolidation just below the local high is a positive sign. It shows that the bulls are in no hurry to book profits, increasing the possibility of a break above $2,200.

On the contrary, if the price plunges below $1,785, it will suggest that bears have seized control. That could start a fall to $1,619.

ETH/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows that the bears could not build upon the break below the 50-simple moving average. This shows that the selling pressure reduces at lower levels. The bulls are trying to stage a recovery by sustaining the price above the 20-EMA. If they can pull it off, the pair will again try to retest the crucial resistance at $2,000.

On the contrary, if ETH price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will suggest that the bears are in command. That could sink the pair to the support line.

Monero price analysis

Monero 

XMR

$153

 is trying to stay above the moving averages, indicating that the bulls are attempting a comeback.

XMR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The flattish 20-day EMA ($156) and the RSI just above the midpoint indicate a balance between supply and demand. If buyers thrust XMR price above the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, the advantage will tilt in their favor.

The XMR/USDT pair may then start a new up-move. There is a minor resistance at $181 but if that is crossed, the pair may reach $187.

Instead, if the price turns down from the current level or the neckline, it will suggest that the bears remain active at higher levels. The sellers will then try to yank the price below the $149-support, opening the door for a decline to $130.

XMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows that the price rebounded off the 50-SMA, but the bulls could not pierce the resistance line. This shows that the bears are selling on rallies. If the price snaps back from the 20-EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment is turning positive and traders are buying on dips.

The bulls will then make another attempt to clear the overhead hurdle. If they manage to do that, the pair could first rise to $162 and then to $164.

Alternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will suggest that bears are in control. That will increase the likelihood of a retest of the support line.

OKB price analysis

OKB (OKB) is trading inside a large symmetrical triangle pattern. Generally, in this setup, traders buy near the support line and sell near the resistance.

OKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears are trying to maintain OKB price below the 50-day SMA ($45.57) while the bulls are attempting to reclaim the level. If the price turns up from the current level or rebounds off the support line, it will suggest demand at lower levels.

If buyers shove the price above the 20-day EMA ($46.87), it will suggest that the OKB/USDT pair may prolong its stay inside the triangle for some more time.

Contrary to this assumption, if bears sink the price below the triangle, it will suggest that the setup has behaved as a reversal pattern. That could start a new downtrend that is likely to pull the pair to $37.

OKB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows that the bulls are trying to defend the horizontal support near $44.35, but they have not been able to propel the price above the moving averages. This suggests that every minor relief rally is being sold into. If the price turns down from the current level and plummets below $44.35, the pair may slump to $41.70.

Conversely, if the price rises above the moving averages, it will signal accumulation at lower levels. The pair could first rise to $49.50 and thereafter attempt a rally to $53.

Rocket Pool price analysis

Rocket Pool (RPL) is looking strong as it is trading above the moving averages. This shows that the bulls are buying on dips.

RPL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls will have to propel the price above the overhead resistance at $53.45 to signal that the corrective phase may be over. The RPL/USDT pair may thereafter attempt a rally to $58.

Another possibility is that RPL price rises from the 20-day EMA ($48.36) but turns down from $53.45. That will indicate a possible range-bound action between the 50-day SMA ($46.13) and $53.45 for some time.

A break and close below the 50-day SMA will be the first indication that the bears are in command. That will open the doors for a potential decline to $37.

RPL/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The four-hour chart shows that the bears are trying to sustain the price below the 20-EMA while the bulls are trying to push the price above it. If buyers succeed, the pair may rise to the downtrend line. This is the key short-term level to watch for. If this resistance is overcome, the pair may rally to $53.45.

Contrarily, if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 50-SMA, the price risks dropping to the support line. The bulls are likely to defend this level fiercely.

Binance closes BTC withdrawals amid congestion on the Bitcoin network

 withdrawals on May 7 due to an alleged overflow of transactions on the Bitcoin network. 

The Bitcoin mempool was clogged with over 400,000 transactions waiting to be processed at the time of writing. The mempool is known as the “waiting area” for incoming transactions before they are verified independently by each node on the network.

Binance tweeted that BTC withdrawals had resumed after nearly an hour of halting. Outflows on the crypto exchange peaked on May 7, rising to $187 million, according to data from CryptoQuant.

Behind the congestion is believed to be a surge in BRC-20 transactions in the last few days due to memecoins like Pepe (PEPE). The memecoin trading hype drove Bitcoin transaction fees to their highest point in two years. On May 3, the total amount of fees paid on the Bitcoin blockchain reached $3.5 million, jumping nearly 400% from late April, Cointelegraph reported.

Developed after Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard, BRC-20 is an experimental token standard recently introduced that allows users to create and transfer fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is currently becoming a hot spot for meme tokens. 

CoinMarketCap’s data shows that PEPE’s price has climbed over 263% in the last week. As of writing, however, the memecoin is down over 7% following a 30% drop on May 6 as whales profited from Binance's recent listing. Crypto exchanges MEXC Global, Bitget, Gate.ioand Huobi listed PEPE trading pairs two weeks ago, kicking off the token hype.

Since the introduction of Dogecoin in 2013, memecoins have become a major part of the cryptocurrency world, making and ruining fortunes alike. Investopedia defines a memecoin as a cryptocurrency represented “with comical or animated memes, that [is] supported by enthusiastic online traders and followers.”

Deloitte integrates blockchain for digital credentials

The credentials will “have multiple use cases,” including regulatory compliance for banking and decentralized finance, age verification for e-commerce, private logins and fundraising.

Big Four accounting firm Deloitte has integrated blockchain technology to allow customers to store verification credentials in a single digital wallet to streamline the “typically inefficient” verification processes.

In a May 4 statement, Deloitte announced it has integrated KILT Protocol technology — a Polkadot parachain — to enable the issuance of reusable digital credentials to its customers. The integration aims to improve the efficiency of Deloitte’s Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) verification processes.

In the statement, Deloitte said the standard and “typically inefficient” processes, including KYC and KYB certificates being issued on paper, and identity verification requests requiring multiple data points when only one is needed, often create “extra work in the process.“

Additionally, these traditional verification procedures store data and personal information across multiple platforms and databases, placing consumer data privacy at risk. 

The credentials will serve various use cases, including regulatory compliance for banking and decentralized finance (DeFi), age verification for e-commerce, private logins and fundraising.

While the wallet will be stored on the customer’s device and remain under their control at all times, Deloitte retains the ability to modify if circumstances change, as noted in the statement:

“Credentials are digitally signed by Deloitte. Deloitte can revoke credentials using blockchain technology if conditions of the customer have changed after the credential was issued.”

The company added that no prior knowledge of blockchain is required from customers to set up the credential wallet.

KILT Protocol founder Ingo Rübe said that the streamlined identity solutions built on KILT allow customers to use verifiable digital credentials across multiple services while maintaining control “over when and where to share personal information.”

As a Polkadot parachain, it also provides the “scale and security needed by enterprise partners,” he added.

Polkadot tweeted shortly after the announcement on May 4, saying that Deloitte leveraging KILT’s solutions to support its KYC and KYB processes is vital for safeguarding itself against illegal activity.

This comes after reports on April 26 that there were over 300 crypto-related job opportunities available at Deloitte, with almost all of them being posted in the same week.

Meanwhile, searching for crypto-related job openings at the other Big Four accounting firms, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers, showed no results.

Internet payment processor Stripe has introduced a fiat-to-crypto on-ramp to address the “cold start problem” faced by Web3 companies due to customers not having “crypto in their wallets to carry out transactions.”

According to a May 4 statement, Stripe’s newly launched fiat-to-crypto on-ramp, which Stripe itself will host, will allow Web3 companies to offer United States-based customers the ability to purchase crypto “at the precise moment they need it” without the need to embed any code into a website or app.

Instead, customers will be directed to a link to convert their fiat into crypto.

Guillaume Poncin, head of engineering for crypto at Stripe, said Stripe would handle several compliance-related tasks for Web3 companies using the on-ramp, including conversion and authorization optimization, identity verification and fraud prevention, to help “customers start using Web3 services quickly and safely.“

It was noted that built-in fraud detection and identity verification tools were implemented to support companies in meeting Know Your Customer and compliance requirements.

Implementing the new on-ramp service aims to support Web3 companies by providing a user-friendly way for customers to top up their crypto wallets. It stated: 

“Companies interested in offering cryptocurrency and blockchain-enabled experiences often face a cold start problem: Their customers don’t have the crypto in their wallets to carry out transactions.”

Several Web3 companies, including privacy-focused browser Brave, decentralized finance protocol 1inch and blockchain protocol Lens Protocol, have already implemented Stripe’s fiat-to-crypto on-ramp, according to the statement.

James Mudgett, vice president of Web3 products at Brave, stated that the service will allow the platform to “reach new Web3 users.”

Meanwhile, 1inch co-founder Sergei Kunz highlighted the importance of building “bridges between Web2 and Web3,” adding that Stripe’s experience with Web3 companies makes it “well positioned to help.“

Related: Crypto-friendly Stripe weighs public offering: Report

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Ohm Shah, co-founder of Wallet Guard, stated that Stripe’s new offering could “allow for many people to easily enter into Web3.”

However, Shah stressed the importance of conducting due diligence before purchasing digital assets, even if the customer is familiar with the company providing the fiat-to-crypto on-ramp. He noted:

“While on-ramping with Stripe to purchase your very first NFT [nonfungible token] can be exciting, it’s important to consider how easy it is to lose your assets as all it takes is one malicious signature.”

This comes after mobile payments service Venmo announced its own fiat-to-crypto payment service on April 28.

During an interview at Consensus 2023, PayPal executive Jose Fernandez da Ponte said the new feature would provide a use case for digital assets because now crypto will be used for “fast and free near-instant transfers between Venmo wallets and PayPal wallets, which is basically connecting two of the largest networks and wallets in the country.”

Meanwhile, Robinhood announced its fiat-to-crypto on-ramp at Consensus on April 27. Robinhood Connect allows users to purchase and sell crypto using a credit or debit card in their self-custody wallet or natively in decentralized applications.

Kazakhstan collected $7M in crypto mining taxes in 2022

Crypto miners paid millions of dollars in energy fees last year following the regulation of mining activities.

The government of Kazakhstan received 3.07 billion tenges (approximately $7 million) in tax payments from crypto mining entities in 2022 following the implementation of an amended law regulating the fiscal burden of mining cryptocurrencies, according to local media reports.

Preliminary data from the government for 2023 shows that mining fees collected by April 27 totaled 240 million tenges, over $541,000 at the time of writing. The figures are much lower than the 652 million tenge (~$1.5 million) in fees paid in the first quarter of 2022. 

Kazakhstan ranks among the world’s top Bitcoin mining hubs. As of January 2022, the Central Asian country contributed 13.22% of the total Bitcoin hash rate, just behind the United States (37.84%) and China (21.11%), according to data from Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.

The country introduced taxes on digital mining on January 1, 2022, based on electricity consumption by mining entities. The law came into effect amid growing national frustration with crypto miners’ undertaxed usage of the national power grid, Cointelegraph reported. The amended legislation was also considered a legal path for further adoption amid tightening regulations worldwide.

A wave of foreign mining operators relocated to Kazakhstan during the 2021 bull market, impacting already tricky relations between the country and miners. Some estimates indicate that more than 87,849 rigs had been brought to the territory by November 2021 following China’s crackdown on mining activities.

Recently, the government announced plans to introduce new crypto regulations to curb tax fraud and unlawful business operations. One of the proposals calls for government approval for secured digital assets issuers, while another would require miners to sell at least 75% of crypto earned via registered exchanges. The move is expected to reduce tax evasion.

The government of Kazakhstan received 3.07 billion tenges (approximately $7 million) in tax payments from crypto mining entities in 2022 following the implementation of an amended law regulating the fiscal burden of mining cryptocurrencies, according to local media reports.

Preliminary data from the government for 2023 shows that mining fees collected by April 27 totaled 240 million tenges, over $541,000 at the time of writing. The figures are much lower than the 652 million tenge (~$1.5 million) in fees paid in the first quarter of 2022. 

Kazakhstan ranks among the world’s top Bitcoin mining hubs. As of January 2022, the Central Asian country contributed 13.22% of the total Bitcoin hash rate, just behind the United States (37.84%) and China (21.11%), according to data from Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance.

The country introduced taxes on digital mining on January 1, 2022, based on electricity consumption by mining entities. The law came into effect amid growing national frustration with crypto miners’ undertaxed usage of the national power grid, Cointelegraph reported. The amended legislation was also considered a legal path for further adoption amid tightening regulations worldwide.

A wave of foreign mining operators relocated to Kazakhstan during the 2021 bull market, impacting already tricky relations between the country and miners. Some estimates indicate that more than 87,849 rigs had been brought to the territory by November 2021 following China’s crackdown on mining activities.

Recently, the government announced plans to introduce new crypto regulations to curb tax fraud and unlawful business operations. One of the proposals calls for government approval for secured digital assets issuers, while another would require miners to sell at least 75% of crypto earned via registered exchanges. The move is expected to reduce tax evasion.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Deus Finance has lost over $6 million due to a security breach on its stablecoin DEI. The hacker exploited a vulnerability in BNB Smart Chain (BSC) on May 5, according to blockchain security firm PeckShield. 

A bot initiated the hack on BSC, which led to a more than $1.3 million loss. The attacker also targeted the Arbitrum network, with ARB/ETH deployments losing over $5 million. Twitter users claimed the token contract had a basic implementation error as the root cause.

The protocol confirmed the attack, paused all contracts and burned DEI tokens to prevent further damage. “We are currently in the process of comprehending the actual backing of DEI tokens,” said the Deus team on Twitter, adding that a “comprehensive recovery and redemption plan” will be created after a full analysis of the balances and snapshots.

DEI is used as a collateral mechanism for third-party instruments built on the Fantom protocol. Its price dropped 30% over the past 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The stablecoin is trading at $0.20 at the time of writing, losing its $0.30 peg. Last year, the stablecoin also lost its $1 peg after the Terra collapse.

It is not the first time that Deus Finance has been hacked. The protocol was exploited in March 2022 in a flash-loan attack, resulting in over $3 million in losses in Dai

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

Bitcoin “in limbo” despite volatility

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD dropping by over $1,000, or 3%, in a matter of hours on the day.

The largest cryptocurrency saw volatile conditions typical of weekend trading but could not exit a broader corridor in place for several weeks.

Amid a lack of ammunition to either clear the $30,000 resistance or drop toward key trend lines near $25,000, BTC/USD frustrated market participants.

“Bitcoin really is in limbo right now and doesn’t know what to do .. I am back out of a position and just waiting again for one side of this range to break to re enter,” popular trader Crypto Tony told Twitter followers.

An accompanying chart showed potential targets in the event of a bearish breakdown.

An additional analysis released earlier in the day repeated previous predictions of $32,000 coming into play should bullish momentum return.

In separate coverage, fellow trader CryptoBullet described the day’s losses as “nothing special.”

“Final dip before the breakout,” part of the commentary argued, with a chart presenting BTC/USD in a narrowing wedge with a decision on exit trajectory due.

BTC price bulls must clear $30,000

As ever, longer timeframes were a cause for more optimistic views.

Analyzing the weekly chart, analyst Gert van Lagen flagged the 200-week simple moving average (SMA) as the resistance line to clear next, with Bitcoin possibly completing a bullish inverse head and shoulders chart pattern.

Trader and investor CryptoAce highlighted a large weekly resistance zone for bulls to tackle.

 could be set for historic gains thanks to a simple trend line breakout, a popular trader hopes.

In a Twitter discussion on May 5, Titan of Crypto flagged a rare bull signal on the Bollinger Bands indicator for the Bitcoin monthly chart.

Bitcoin price may see “inexorable breakout”

BTC price action currently impacts sentiment in different ways across various timeframes. While observers are unsure about short-term moves, the consensus remains that Bitcoin’s upside mainly lies ahead as the block subsidy halving approaches.

When tracking what comes next, however, it may be enough to look at past halving cycles, specifically, volatility.

As Titan of Crypto notes, Bollinger Bands on monthly timeframes are setting up a repeat of a breakout event that has occurred only once in each cycle.

In the two previous instances shown on an accompanying chart from 2016 and 2019, BTC/USD broke through into the upper section of the Bollinger Band channel to see significant gains.

Bollinger Bands are a key volatility indicator across price timeframes. They revolve around a 20-period simple moving average (SMA) functioning as a midline, with two standard deviations above and below representing the channel.

These bands expand and contract with volatility and certain events: among them, the price coming into contact with the bands or even breaking beyond them is often considered important by traders.

Currently, the one-month BTC/USD chart shows the price attempting to break above the SMA line, which, if confirmed, would suggest a classic repeat of past bull runs.

Commenting, Titan of Crypto described it as an “inexorable breakout.“

”BTC is about to break its monthly Bollinger Bands base line. And when that happens 1st target will follow inexorably,” he added.

“That would bring Bitcoin to a solid $63,500.”

While not quite enough to match its current all-time high, the price target could come around the point of the halving in one year’s time. How long it will need in reality remains to be seen, Titan of Crypto acknowledged.

BTC price bides its time

Last month, John Bollinger, the band’s creator, himself argued that Bitcoin was at a crucial point on daily timeframes.

At the time, the price was retesting the SMA line as support, breaking through to range around it. Now, however, it is heading higher toward the upper band, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.

Subsequently, analyst CryptoCon suggested that low-timeframe Bollinger Bands norms remained intact despite Bitcoin’s comedown from local highs of $31,000.

US Justice Department investigating Binance for violating Russian sanctions: Report

The DOJ’s national security and crime divisions are both looking at the cryptocurrency exchange’s provision of services to Russians, Bloomberg reports.

Binance is under investigation by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) national security division for allowing Russians to use the cryptocurrency exchange in violation of U.S. sanctions, according to a report that appeared in Bloomberg on May 5. There have been no accusations against the company or its executive in connection with the investigation.

The national security probe is being carried out in tandem with a criminal division investigation, the news service said, citing five unnamed sources. Binance is the object of several investigations in the United States, including a DOJ inquiry into Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations.

Binance limited services to Russia after sanctions were imposed on the country in April 2022. Still, it continued operating there, blocking only areas of Ukraine that were no longer under government control and servicing only non-sanctioned individuals, according to a company executive speaking to Cointelegraph.

The Justice Department is investigating whether Binance was used illegally to let Russians skirt US sanctions and move money through the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange https://t.co/AVgG55iSmx

— Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) May 5, 2023

Binance has also been accused of Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML violations in a suit brought by the U.S. Commodity and Futures Trading Commission in March.

Related: Brazilian authorities investigate Binance for guiding clients past stop order: Report

The company did not reply immediately to an inquiry from Cointelegraph, but it told Bloomberg in a statement that it was compliant with U.S. and international sanctions, and its KYC protocols are in line with those of traditional banking. Every customer is subject to identity and residency checks, it said. Furthermore:

“Our policy imposes a zero-tolerance approach to double registrations, anonymous identities, and obscure sources of money.”

In addition, according to Bloomberg, Binance “has been in discussions” with the DOJ about complaints that it had violated a previous version of sanctions against Iran.

Binance is not the only crypto exchange to face sanctions violation scrutiny. Poloniex paid a $7.6 million settlement to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control for violating sanctions against Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria, according to a May 1 announcement.

On May 4, Argentina's central bank banned payment providers from offering crypto transactions, alleging it intends to reduce the country's payment-system exposure to digital assets.

According to a statement from the monetary authority, payment providers may not offer or facilitate crypto services through their applications. The move brings payment fintechs and financial institutions under the same rules in the country.

""Payment service providers that offer payment accounts [...] may not carry out or facilitate operations with digital assets, including crypto assets, that are not regulated by the competent national authority and authorized by the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic,"" said the authority. Cryptocurrencies are not regulated in Argentina, which means all coins and tokens are subject to the decision.

It's unclear how the measure will affect the local crypto industry. Local media reported that payment providers refused to comment on the decision. Argentina's fintech chamber urged the government to reconsider the decision, claiming that ""it limits access to a technology that offers multiple benefits and opportunities for our society.""

Hyperinflation is driving crypto adoption in Argentina. In April, the price of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,809

 reached a record high in the Argentine peso (ARS), with the BTC exchange rate crossing over 6.59 million ARS — up more than 100% year-to-date.

In March, inflation in the country soared by 104.3% on an annual basis, following a 102.5% jump in the previous month, data from the national statistics office show.

Bitcoin’s popularity in the country also coincides with the ongoing devaluation of the Argentine peso, Cointelegraph reported. The currency has fallen almost 50% against the United States dollar in the past year.

Amid the ongoing economic crisis, even some Argentinian cities are seeking a safe haven in cryptocurrencies. Last December, the Argentine province of San Luis allowed the issuance of its own stablecoin pegged to the U.S dollar, available to all residents and 100% collateralized with liquid financial assets.

Chainalysis found that over 30% of consumers in Argentina use stablecoins for everyday purchases, most likely for small retail transactions under $1,000.

United States inflation and how it might affect the price of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,809

 are two of the top concerns on investors’ minds around the world. To illustrate, one prominent crypto personality bet big bucks on the future of the U.S. economy: the former Coinbase executive recently paid out $1.5 million to settle a Twitter wager about possible hyperinflation in the American economy.

The U.S. may not be experiencing hyperinflation, but the possibility of prices going out of control seems to concern the Federal Reserve. The Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-point on May 3 — to the highest level in 16 years — pushing the target range for its benchmark from 5% to 5.25%.

As inflation pressures continue, Bitcoin is still seen as a safe haven for many, with crypto firms weighing on the digital currency to fight back inflation and turmoil in mainstream finance.

This week’s Crypto Biz explores the latest wild wager on Bitcoin prices, inflation fears and the jobs that artificial intelligence may soon replace.

Balaji pays out his crazy $1 million Bitcoin bet, 97% under price target

A closely watched wager between former Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan and pseudonymous Twitter user James Medlock has been closed, with Srinivasan paying $1.5 million to settle. The wager commenced on March 17 when Medlock offered to bet anyone $1 million that the United States would not experience hyperinflation. A few hours later, the former Coinbase executive accepted the bet, claiming that an impending crisis would lead to the deflation of the U.S. dollar and, thus, to a hyperinflation scenario, taking the BTC price to $1 million. As part of the deal, Srinivasan paid Medlock $500,000, donated $500,000 to Bitcoin core developers and gave an additional $500,000 to the nonprofit charity, Give Directly.

MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin conviction ‘strong’ as it posts Q1 profit

The Bitcoin investment strategy is as strong as ever at business intelligence platform MicroStrategy after the company posted its first quarterly profit since 2020. The firm returned to the green with a profit of $94 million, primarily attributed to a one-time income tax benefit of $453.2 million. The firm further reduced its leverage by repaying a $161 million Bitcoin-backed loan from the now-collapsed Silverage Bank. The quarterly results were also impacted by a revenue rise of 2.2% from last year to $121.9 million. MicroStrategy’s CEO Phong Lee said the firm would continue to execute its dual strategy of growing business intelligence software and acquiring Bitcoin. The firm believes its Bitcoin thesis is a “pretty good way to outperform the market.”

Coinbase stock will be ‘weighed down’ until US rules are clear: Citi

Coinbase’s stock price will continue to be “weighed down” until regulators establish the legal “rules of the road” in the United States, Citi analysts say. The bank downgraded shares of the crypto exchange from “buy” to “neutral” and lowered its price target, citing “too many unknowns” as the company battles it out with regulators. However, bearish sentiment on Coinbase’s stock is not stopping investment firm ARK Invest from increasing its exposure to the crypto exchange. ARK purchased 168,869 Coinbase shares for its exchange-traded funds on May 1, worth nearly $8.5 million. In April, ARK bagged 304,300 shares worth $17.5 million. Previously, the firm bought 2.4 million shares in March for about $117 million.

Citi's analysis was published prior to Coinbase's Q1 earnings report released on May 4.

7,800 jobs at IBM could be replaced by AI within years, CEO suggests

IBM is expecting to put a “pause” on hiring for “back-office” roles that could be potentially automated by artificial intelligence instead. According to the company CEO, Arvind Krishna, back-office positions, such as those in human resources and accounting departments, will likely be the first to be automated by AI. Nearly 30% of these positions will “easily” be replaced by AI over five years, claimed Krishna in an interview. IBM employs 282,000 employees globally, according to LinkedIn data. Non-customer-facing staff sits at nearly 26,000.

Before you go: The average person’s wealth will be ‘completely destroyed by inflation,' says Arthur Hayes

The majority of people will have their wealth progressively eaten away by the devaluation of money, according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX. He believes the world’s largest economies will be forced to inflate away the sizeable public debt accumulated in the past years through money printing. With long-term inflation on the horizon, Hayes’s investment thesis focuses on preserving wealth through investing in digital assets.

United States inflation and how it might affect the price of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,809

 are two of the top concerns on investors’ minds around the world. To illustrate, one prominent crypto personality bet big bucks on the future of the U.S. economy: the former Coinbase executive recently paid out $1.5 million to settle a Twitter wager about possible hyperinflation in the American economy.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

The U.S. may not be experiencing hyperinflation, but the possibility of prices going out of control seems to concern the Federal Reserve. The Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-point on May 3 — to the highest level in 16 years — pushing the target range for its benchmark from 5% to 5.25%.

As inflation pressures continue, Bitcoin is still seen as a safe haven for many, with crypto firms weighing on the digital currency to fight back inflation and turmoil in mainstream finance.

This week’s Crypto Biz explores the latest wild wager on Bitcoin prices, inflation fears and the jobs that artificial intelligence may soon replace.

Balaji pays out his crazy $1 million Bitcoin bet, 97% under price target

A closely watched wager between former Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan and pseudonymous Twitter user James Medlock has been closed, with Srinivasan paying $1.5 million to settle. The wager commenced on March 17 when Medlock offered to bet anyone $1 million that the United States would not experience hyperinflation. A few hours later, the former Coinbase executive accepted the bet, claiming that an impending crisis would lead to the deflation of the U.S. dollar and, thus, to a hyperinflation scenario, taking the BTC price to $1 million. As part of the deal, Srinivasan paid Medlock $500,000, donated $500,000 to Bitcoin core developers and gave an additional $500,000 to the nonprofit charity, Give Directly.

MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin conviction ‘strong’ as it posts Q1 profit

The Bitcoin investment strategy is as strong as ever at business intelligence platform MicroStrategy after the company posted its first quarterly profit since 2020. The firm returned to the green with a profit of $94 million, primarily attributed to a one-time income tax benefit of $453.2 million. The firm further reduced its leverage by repaying a $161 million Bitcoin-backed loan from the now-collapsed Silverage Bank. The quarterly results were also impacted by a revenue rise of 2.2% from last year to $121.9 million. MicroStrategy’s CEO Phong Lee said the firm would continue to execute its dual strategy of growing business intelligence software and acquiring Bitcoin. The firm believes its Bitcoin thesis is a “pretty good way to outperform the market.” 

Coinbase stock will be ‘weighed down’ until US rules are clear: Citi

Coinbase’s stock price will continue to be “weighed down” until regulators establish the legal “rules of the road” in the United States, Citi analysts say. The bank downgraded shares of the crypto exchange from “buy” to “neutral” and lowered its price target, citing “too many unknowns” as the company battles it out with regulators. However, bearish sentiment on Coinbase’s stock is not stopping investment firm ARK Invest from increasing its exposure to the crypto exchange. ARK purchased 168,869 Coinbase shares for its exchange-traded funds on May 1, worth nearly $8.5 million. In April, ARK bagged 304,300 shares worth $17.5 million. Previously, the firm bought 2.4 million shares in March for about $117 million.

Citi's analysis was published prior to Coinbase's Q1 earnings report released on May 4.

7,800 jobs at IBM could be replaced by AI within years, CEO suggests

IBM is expecting to put a “pause” on hiring for “back-office” roles that could be potentially automated by artificial intelligence instead. According to the company CEO, Arvind Krishna, back-office positions, such as those in human resources and accounting departments, will likely be the first to be automated by AI. Nearly 30% of these positions will “easily” be replaced by AI over five years, claimed Krishna in an interview. IBM employs 282,000 employees globally, according to LinkedIn data. Non-customer-facing staff sits at nearly 26,000. 

Before you go: The average person’s wealth will be ‘completely destroyed by inflation,' says Arthur Hayes

The majority of people will have their wealth progressively eaten away by the devaluation of money, according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX. He believes the world’s largest economies will be forced to inflate away the sizeable public debt accumulated in the past years through money printing. With long-term inflation on the horizon, Hayes’s investment thesis focuses on preserving wealth through investing in digital assets.

Welcome to Finance Redefined, your weekly dose of essential decentralized finance (DeFi) insights — a newsletter crafted to bring you the most significant developments from the past week.

April saw several hacks, exploits and rug pulls that resulted in a net loss of over $100 million among several DeFi protocols.

Amid the growing memecoin frenzy, the chances of exploits have increased multifold, with WallStreetBets — a popular trading sub-Reddit group — allegedly rugging its users for $635,000 just days after airdropping about $15,000.

DeFi protocol Level Finance was a victim of an exploit resulting in the loss of nearly $1 million. The attacker manipulated a “claim multiple” bug in a Level Finance smart contract to steal more than 214,000 native Level Finance (LVL) tokens from the exchange.

The volume of liquid staking protocols has dramatically risen in the past couple of weeks, overtaking decentralized exchanges (DEXs). From April 13 to May 1, the total value locked (TVL) on decentralized exchanges declined by $1.66 billion, while it increased on liquid staking protocols by $280 million.

Liquid staking solutions now have more TVL than DEXs: DefiLlama

Liquid staking solutions like Lido and Rocket Pool now have a higher total value locked than DEXs, making them the top category of DeFi protocols according to data from the crypto analytics platform DefiLlama.

Liquid staking protocols have just recently taken the top spot. On April 13, $17.19 billion of crypto was locked in liquid staking contracts, compared with $18.89 billion in DEXs, according to archived information. However, DEXs have experienced a $1.66 billion decline to $17.2 billion, while liquid staking solutions have experienced a $280 million increase to $17.47 billion.

April’s crypto scams, exploits and hacks lead to $103 million lost — CertiK

Crypto exploits, exit scams and flash loan attacks did not let up in April, with more than $103 million of funds stolen from crypto projects and investors. On April 30, crypto security and auditing firm CertiK posted an April roundup of crypto exploits, scams and hacks, revealing total funds lost was $103.7 million, bringing total year-to-date losses to $429.7 million.

The month was marred with significant crypto exploits, with $25.4 million lost due to an exploit of several maximal extractable value trading bots on April 3, $22 million stolen in a hot wallet exploit at the Bitrue exchange, and the $13 million hack of South Korean GDAC exchange.

WallStreetBets mod dumps memecoin worth $635,000 in alleged rug pull

A moderator of the popular trading subreddit r/WallStreetBets has dumped a large portion of WSB Coin (WSB), a token project claiming to be the official memecoin of Wall Street Bets.

On May 2, WSB was launched by people involved in moderating the WallStreetBets Reddit forum. The subreddit gained notoriety for the GameStop short squeeze, which sent hedge funds to their knees in January 2021. The creators of the WSB token claimed that there would be no allocation for the team and that 10% of the coins would be reserved for the subreddit.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

PacWest Bancorp’s 50% price decline and the ongoing banking crisis are the first topics of this week’s show. The bank holds $40 billion in assets, although 80% of its lending portfolio has been assigned to commercial real estate loans and residential mortgages. The issue? As usual, rising interest rates. Meanwhile, the total underwater bond position of United States banks is $600 billion, not including derivatives.

However, the U.S. Treasury has been bailing out every one of the latest three bankruptcies: Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Signature Bank and First Republic. SVB’s losses are estimated at $20 billion, or 15% of the total Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) capacity.

Pechman explains how Bitcoin’s 

BTC

$27,809

 price should react in case PacWest Bancorp fails and why gold has recently flirted with its all-time high above $2,050. More importantly, how the banking crisis impacts government debt, which is spiraling out of control — consequently, extremely positive for Bitcoin in the long run.

The next concluding segment of Macro Markets focuses on oil prices, as the energy commodity traded down 17.5% in three weeks. Pechman shows how the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) doesn’t really control production and how the U.S. government played a key role in diminishing the demand for oil imports.

According to Pechman, the biggest take for Bitcoin is the potential oil demand flatline due to weaker economic conditions, which can be deemed a short-term negative driver for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, has announced the inspection of sites across the country “suspected of hosting illegally operated crypto ATMs.”

In a May 5 announcement, the FCA said it had coordinated with local authorities in the cities of Exeter, Nottingham and Sheffield to raid facilities suspected of operating unregistered cryptocurrency ATMs. The enforcement action followed similar operations from March in East London and February around the city of Leeds, where the FCA said it had issued warnings or cease-and-desist requests to suspected crypto ATM operators.

“The action we’ve taken over the past few months and wider work shows that we will act to stop illegal activity,” said Therese Chambers, executive director of enforcement and market oversight of FCA. “Besides disrupting unregistered crypto businesses, the joint efforts have helped raise awareness of illegally operated crypto ATMs in the UK among the public.”

FCA authorities cited its powers under the U.K.’s Money Laundering Regulations from 2017 in conducting the inspections. According to the financial watchdog, it planned to review evidence gathered and “consider taking further action where necessary.”

According to data from CoinATMRadar, there were more than 15 crypto ATMS in the U.K. at the time of publication by operators including Big Sea Coins, BD ATMs, Cryptobitecoin and Computer House. It’s unclear whether any were registered under the FCA.

Confidence in the United States financial system seems to be eroding fast, with investors trying to find the next weakest link that is about to collapse. Bill Ackman, CEO of hedge fund management firm Pershing Square, cautioned that time was running out to fix the problem.

The U.S. equities markets have become vulnerable to adverse news on the regional banks, as seen from the sell-off in the past three days. Compared to that, Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,809

 has held strong and is hovering near its critical overhead resistance at $31,000.

Bitcoin is not the only outperformer. Gold had risen close to its all-time high during the week. This shows that Bitcoin is currently behaving as a safe-haven asset and investors are adding it to their portfolios along with gold.

Could Bitcoin overcome the barrier at $31,000 and extend the up move? Will the altcoins follow Bitcoin higher? Studying the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies can help answer these questions.

Bitcoin price analysis

Bitcoin continues to trade inside the symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. Usually, the trend that was in force before the formation of the triangle tends to resume. That means the price is likely to break out to the upside.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price closes above the triangle, the BTC/USDT pair could rally to $32,400. The bears are expected to mount a strong defense at this level because if the bulls drive the price above $32,400, the rally could reach $40,000.

Contrarily, if the price turns down from the resistance line, it will suggest that the pair may continue its random price action inside the triangle for a few more days.

A break and close below the triangle will indicate that the bears have overpowered the bulls. The pair may then tumble to $25,250.

Ethereum price analysis

The bulls pushed Ether 

ETH

$1,859

 above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on May 5. This shows that the bulls absorbed the supply and have come out on top.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If buyers sustain the price above the triangle, the ETH/USDT pair could first rise to $2,000 and then attempt a rally to $2,200. The bears may aggressively defend this level because if they fail to do that, the pair may skyrocket toward $3,000.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level and re-enters the triangle, it will suggest that the breakout may have been a bull trap. The pair may then once again drop to the support line. A break below this level may sink the pair to the target objective of $1,619.

BNB price analysis

BNB 

BNB

$315

 is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The flattish 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $326 and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price breaks above the 20-day EMA, the BNB/USDT pair may continue to oscillate inside the triangle for some more time.

A break below the triangle will indicate that bears have seized control. That is likely to start a downward move to $300 and then to the pattern target of $280. If bulls want to gain the upper hand, they will have to propel the price above the triangle. That will clear the path for a possible rally to $350 and then $400.

XRP price analysis

XRP 

XRP

$0.42

 formed an inside-day candlestick pattern on May 4 and a Doji candlestick pattern on May 5. This suggests that the bulls and the bears are playing it safe and are not waging large bets.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative territory, signaling that bears have a slight edge. The bears will try to sink the price to the strong support level at $0.43.

Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the 20-day EMA ($0.47), it will indicate solid buying at lower levels. The XRP/USDT pair may then rise to the resistance line. Buyers will have to overcome this resistance to open up the possibility of a rally to $0.54.

Cardano price analysis

Cardano 

ADA

$0.366

 dipped below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $0.38 on May 3 and 5, but the long tail on the candlestick shows that the bulls are aggressively defending the support near $0.37.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Buyers tried to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($0.39) on May 4, but the bears did not budge. The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bears. If the price turns down and crumbles below $0.37, the selling could intensify and the ADA/USDT pair may descend to $0.33 and then $0.30.

If bulls want to prevent this decline, they will have to quickly propel the price above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. That could increase the chances of a rally to $0.46 and later $0.52.

Dogecoin price analysis

The bulls have managed to keep Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 above the immediate support near $0.08, but they have failed to achieve a meaningful bounce off it. This suggests that demand dries up at higher levels.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

A tight consolidation near a strong support level generally resolves to the downside. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.08) and the RSI in the negative zone also indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside.

If the support near $0.08 gives way, the DOGE/USDT pair may tumble to the next major support level of $0.07. This negative view will invalidate in the near term if buyers thrust the DOGE price above the downtrend line.

Polygon price analysis

Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8827

 attempted to rise above the 20-day EMA ($1.02) on May 3 and 4, but the bears successfully protected the level.

MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The downsloping moving averages and the RSI near 43 suggest that the bears are in command. If the price turns down and breaks below $0.94, the MATIC/USDT pair will complete a descending triangle pattern. That could start a down move toward $0.69.

Instead, if the price turns up and rises above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the lower levels continue to attract buyers. The pair could then rally to the resistance line where the bears are again likely to sell aggressively.

Solana price analysis

Solana 

SOL

$21

 has been trading in a tight range for the past three days. This suggests a state of indecision among the buyers and sellers.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest that the SOL/USDT pair may remain stuck inside the large range between $15.28 and $27.12 for some time. If the price slips and sustains below the 50-day SMA ($21.90), it will suggest that the bears have the upper hand in the near term. The pair could then slide to $18.70.

On the other hand, if buyers kick the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair may start its march toward $24 and then $27.12.

Polkadot price analysis

Sellers yanked Polkadot 

DOT

$5.37

 below the $5.70 support level on May 3, but the long tail shows solid buying at lower levels. The bulls again thwarted attempts by the bears to break the support on May 4 and 5.

DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The repeated failure to sustain the price below $5.70 may attract buyers. Bulls will then try to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($5.96). If they do that, the DOT/USDT pair could rise to the 50-day SMA ($6.18). Buyers will have to overcome this hurdle to gain the upper hand in the near term. The next target on the upside is $7.

Alternatively, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that bears continue to sell on minor rallies. The sellers will then again attempt to tug the price below $5.70 and challenge the crucial support at $5.15.

Litecoin price analysis

The long tail on Litecoin’s 

LTC

$79.75

 May 3 and 5 candlestick shows that the bulls continue to guard the $85 level with vigor, but they are struggling to clear the overhead hurdle at the moving averages.

LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The LTC/USDT pair is stuck in a tight range as the bulls are buying on dips while the bears are selling on rallies. The 20-day EMA ($89) is sloping down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a minor advantage to the bears. A break below the $85 level will indicate that bears have taken control. The pair may then collapse to $75.

Instead, if buyers propel the price above the moving averages, the pair could rally to the overhead resistance at $96. If the price turns down from this level, it will point to possible range-bound action between $85 and $96 for a few days.

Will Biden’s plan to tax crypto mining reduce emissions? Critics say no

The tax is intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, electricity costs and local environmental pollution, but has not been kindly received by the crypto community.

Cryptocurrency miners based in the United States could soon face a tax equal to 30% of the cost of electricity they use if President Joe Biden’s proposed budget for the fiscal year 2024 is approved by Congress, but the proposal has sparked debate about whether it would actually decrease global emissions and energy prices.

Cryptocurrency mining is a resource-intensive process that attempts to solve increasingly complex equations in order to create new blocks which can then be validated and added to the blockchain.

This process consumes a significant amount of energy, with some estimates placing the global energy consumption of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,809

 mining alone at around 0.59% of the world's energy usage, which is roughly equivalent to the energy usage of Malaysia, according to Worldometer.

Biden’s  Council of Economic Advisors (CEA), argues that the tax — dubbed the Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) excise tax — “encourages firms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society,” adding:

“Estimated to raise $3.5 billion in revenue over 10 years, the primary goal of the DAME tax is to start having cryptominers pay their fair share of the costs imposed on local communities and the environment.”

By imposing a tax on electricity usage crypto miners will have a financial incentive to reduce their energy consumption, and with electricity generation making up such a large proportion of carbon emissions, this should theoretically reduce emissions in the U.S.

This idea is similar to the thinking behind carbon taxes, which are intended to disincentivize emitters by forcing them to pay the full social cost of their emissions after attempting to factor in costs associated with polluting.

Leakage

However, opponents of the tax argue that it will simply drive miners offshore to countries with lower tax rates and less stringent environmental regulations, where they will continue to emit large amounts of carbon dioxide. This situation is known as “carbon leakage,” whereby emissions are simply shifted from one location to another, rather than reduced overall.

As Coin Metrics co-founder Nic Carter points out, these countries may also have a much lower proportion of energy supplied by renewable sources, so emissions may even increase as crypto miners move offshore.

Carter was scathing in his critique of the policy, arguing that it would decrease tax revenue contrary to what the Biden administration suggests, increase carbon emissions, and empower “geopolitical enemies.”

In its blog post, the CEA noted that “the potential for cryptomining to relocate abroad — such as to areas with dirtier energy production — is a concern” but suggested that other countries are also moving to restrict crypto mining, and cited nine countries that already had banned the activity.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, environmental group Greenpeace USA's Bitcoin project lead Joshua Archer warned that regulations or taxes deterring crypto mining will likely be created wherever crypto miners move to, and argued that Bitcoin should eliminate its proof-of-work consensus mechanism.

The climate activism group has been calling for Bitcoin to transition to a proof-of-stake mechanism as part of its ongoing “change the code, not the climate” campaign which began early last year. 

One of the countries referred to by the CEA, China, banned crypto mining in 2021 after citing concerns about its electricity consumption and environmental impact. However, studies on the effect of the ban suggest that activity had simply moved to countries that use far less renewable energy, and actually increased global emissions.

The CEA also argued that crypto miner's electricity usage drives up costs for other consumers, and increases overall reliance on “dirtier sources of electricity.”

While this makes sense according to economic theory, as an increase in demand within a market leads to higher prices, it may overlook some important nuances of the crypto-mining industry and its effect on the electricity market in the U.S.

‘Beauty of Bitcoin’

Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings’s CEO Fred Thiel told Cointelegraph that “The beauty of Bitcoin mining is that it naturally incentivizes renewable energy generation.”

Thiel elaborated that “In many cases, green energy sources — such as solar and wind farms — are only feasible if there is consistent demand for that energy when it is produced,” adding:

“While most consumers’ energy needs fluctuate, miners act as consistent base load energy consumers. They help stabilize the grid, making new green energy projects financially feasible.”

According to Thiel, while Bitcoin mining incentivizes the production of renewable energy generation, Bitcoin miners in the U.S. are also drawn to renewable energy sources, as the excess energy they produce which is unable to be returned to the grid is some of the cheapest energy available in the U.S.

Thiel added that if this excess energy was not used by Bitcoin mining firms, it would not be able to be used by consumers and would otherwise be wasted.

Thiel noted that this mutually beneficial relationship between renewable energy producers and Bitcoin miners is contributing to an already ongoing shift towards more sustainable sources of electricity, pointing to the most recent survey by the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC).

Based on the results of the survey, the BMC estimated that 58.9% of the electricity used in Bitcoin mining throughout the last quarter of 2022 was generated by renewable energy sources, a number that is increasing over time.

AI Eye: ‘Biggest ever’ leap in AI, cool new tools, AIs are the real DAOs

Thiel was also very scathing of the DAME tax, arguing that “it is a shot at a specific industry, not at a specific practice or fuel source,” adding:

“If the Biden Administration really wanted to reduce global emissions, it would target the ways electricity is generated – not arbitrarily target select industries that use it.”

He said that the proposal “is intended to run Bitcoin miners out of business” and “will both raise energy prices for consumers and reduce the feasibility of renewable energy development in the U.S.,” concluding:

""Either the administration is utterly misguided, or this proposed tax is nothing more than a move to hamper this industry for political reasons, because it is not in the interest of the people, the energy grid, or the environment.""

The proposal comes amid calls that a lack of regulatory clarity and access to banking services in the U.S. is killing its crypto industry, and if the DAME tax is approved by Congress it may just be one more nail in the coffin.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

New York AG’s office seeks additional authority over crypto firms

Under a bill proposed by New York Attorney General Letitia James, crypto exchanges could be required to reimburse users who were the victims of fraud.

Letitia James has reportedly proposed legislation that would give the New York Attorney General’s office more authority to regulate the crypto industry.

In a May 5 announcement, the NY AG’s office planned to submit a bill called the Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency and Oversight Act, or CRPTO, in the state’s 2023 legislative session. The proposed legislation would give New York officials the enforcement power to issue subpoenas, impose civil penalties for crypto firms violating state law, and shut down companies allegedly involved in fraud or illicit activities.

Under CRPTO, exchanges would be required to reimburse users who were the victims of fraud. It would also codify the term “stablecoin” to only apply to tokens that remained backed with 1:1 United States dollar reserves or “high-quality liquid assets.”

“For too long, fraud in the cryptocurrency industry has caused investors to lose hundreds of billions, with low-income investors and people of color suffering the most,” said James. “Banks and other financial services are regulated. The cryptocurrency industry must be too.”

Today, my office is introducing nation-leading legislation to tighten regulations on the cryptocurrency industry.

We're proposing commonsense measures to protect investors and end the fraud and dysfunction that have become the hallmarks of cryptocurrency.

— NY AG James (@NewYorkStateAG) May 5, 2023

The New York State Department of Financial Services, or NYDFS, currently has the authority to issue BitLicenses to crypto firms operating in the state and oversee many aspects of the digital asset space. James’ bill would also aim to strengthen that authority.

James’ office has previously taken action against crypto firms, including KuCoin, alleging the company sold securities and commodities to residents without registering in New York. The AG also filed a lawsuit against Celsius founder and former CEO Alex Mashinsky in January, claiming he made numerous “false and misleading statements” that led to investors losing billions.

New York lawmakers would need to vote on the proposed bill should it be introduced. In 2022, the legislature passed a two-year moratorium on Bitcoin

Despite Hong Kong steadily progressing with cryptocurrency adoption, mainland China has not changed its anti-crypto stance in terms of local regulations.

Some Chinese state-affiliated banks have increasingly opened bank accounts to serve crypto clients in Hong Kong. CPIC Investment Management — a China government-backed firm regulated as a Hong Kong entity — even launched two cryptocurrency funds in April.

All these developments don’t mean that China has softened or will soften its approach to regulating Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,815

 anytime soon, according to CPIC Investment Management CEO Chenggang Zhou.

“The Hong Kong government tries very hard to promote Web3 and crypto, but it doesn’t imply any changes in mainland regulatory regulations or the Chinese government’s attitude toward crypto,” Zhou said in an interview with Cointelegraph on May 5.

Zhou emphasized that despite China government’s backing, CPIC Investment Management operates as a Hong Kong entity regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission.

“Hong Kong regulations allow us to invest in different markets or asset classes or products like cryptocurrencies, so we’re not breaching any regulations or laws,” the CEO said. He added:

“We got involved in crypto because Hong Kong regulations allow us to do that. But it’s in no way any indication of the China government’s attitude or policy, or change of policy.”

China has maintained its anti-crypto stance for a long time, even before banning crypto entirely in September 2021, Zhou noted. He said that he doesn’t expect the local government to change its crypto policies in the foreseeable future.

The CEO isn’t alone in thinking that China remains and will remain anti-crypto while trying to beef up Chinese bank deposits with crypto accounts.

“Given that the Chinese government is coming down hard on the financial sector, it is hard to imagine that China is loosening its control over the ability for Chinese nationals to use crypto,” Lesperance & Associates founder David Lesperance told Cointelegraph.

Related: Hong Kong court rules cryptocurrencies as property

According to Lesperance, China wants to increase its foreign currency deposits, whether that is fiat to purchase crypto or crypto itself. “They are bifurcating the markets to shut out domestic Chinese customers but attracting foreign customers,” he noted.

The lawyer also noted that the crypto market in mainland China is “still effectively shut down.” That raises enforcement concerns about Chinese clients getting a chance to use Hong Kong exchanges to get money out of China. “Certainly, the authorities will try to stop this leakage,” Lesperance noted.

CPIC’s Zhou also mentioned that crypto exchanges in Hong Kong have strict Know Your Customer policies, which aim to restrict mainland Chinese investors on their platforms.

“I don’t expect any licensed crypto exchanges in Hong Kong to accept onshore mainland citizens to trade in the exchanges,” Zhou stated.

Memecoin mania: Social relevance, speculation drives PEPE surge

Memecoins are back in the headlines as PEPE booms, taking the market capitalization of speculative tokens over $20 billion.

Memecoins have been part and parcel of the cryptocurrency space since the inception of Dogecoin back in 2013, with fortunes made and ruined in equal measure. But a new token on the block caused a stir in recent weeks, as Pepe (PEPE) grabs a chunk of the memecoin market share from plucky investors.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, PEPE saw a 2,000% boom in value following its launch in late April 2023. The token’s rally is primarily attributed to zealous memecoin hype, with the project widely shared on Twitter over the past month.

The Pepe website itself is brandished with a closing disclaimer, labeling PEPE as “a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return.“ The project also stipulates that it has no formal team or roadmap and that the token is “completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.“

Data analytics firm Nansen provided insightful data and key takeaways following the rise of PEPE’s market capitalization. Research analyst Xin Yi estimated that the total memecoin market value is around $20 billion, with the top five tokens, Dogecoin

, Shiba Inu 

SHIB

, PEPE, Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) and Floki (FLOKI), accounting for over $18 billion of the value.

Data provided from Nansen Query shows the massive spike in token value and market capitalization of PEPE in relation to the other top five memecoins. Yi also notes that the infographic does not paint a complete picture, given that the data for PEPE reflects its listing on CoinGecko, which came a couple of weeks after its inception.

Yi told Cointelegraph that the social aspect of memecoins remains a significant driver of investor sentiment and action, highlighting the likes of Elon Musk’s infamous Dogecoin touts and rampant Twitter bots driving memecoin hashtags to relevance on Twitter:

“Since memecoins have no intrinsic value, it relies on catalysts such as social relevance and also events like 4/20, which is known as DOGE day, can affect the prices of the token as well.”

As previously explored, Nansen provides data analytics and insights into “smart money” cryptocurrency traders and holders by labeling wallets and tracking trades. The rise of PEPE has also attracted a significant number of smart money holders, as per on-chain data highlighted by Yi. She added that a few thousand traders might benefit from the surge in the value of memecoins, which is a gamble given that many other memecoins are pump-and-dump or rug-pull schemes:

“Nonetheless, gains on one good coin can easily surpass the cost of the other ‘failed’ coins, which is probably why these memecoins remain attractive for most traders to ape into. Hence, it really depends on the investor’s risk appetite.”

Nevertheless, Yi also pointed out that the inherent risk of memecoins often leads to liquidity crunches, where major tokenholders dump their holdings, leaving smaller investors reeling from losses.

A number of cryptocurrency exchanges listed PEPE in the wake of its launch and subsequent investor appeal, including the likes of OKX, MEXC Global, Bitget, Gate.io and Huobi.

Bitcoin transaction fees surged in early May, reaching their highest point over the past two years, according to data from Crypto Fees.

On May 3, the total amount of fees paid on the Bitcoin blockchain reached $3.5 million, jumping about 400% from late April. The average Bitcoin transaction fee reached as much as $7.2, according to YCharts.

The latest increase in BTC transaction fees is primarily attributed to a surge in Bitcoin activity involving BRC-20 transactions. According to data from Galaxy Research, 50% of all Bitcoin transactions on May 2 were related to BRC-20 transactions.

Modeled after Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard, BRC-20 is an experimental token standard allowing users to issue and transfer fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The standard was introduced in March 2023 by a pseudonymous on-chain analyst known as Domo.

The BRC-20 token standard has quickly become a major trend in the cryptocurrency industry, specifically amid the sharp growth of the PEPE memecoin. The token has rallied more than 600% over the past seven days, reaching its all-time high of $0.00000216 on May 5.

The Bitcoin blockchain isn’t the only blockchain affected by the ongoing memecoin hype. Gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain have also been skyrocketing to new multi-month highs recently.

On May 2, ETH transaction fees hit an aggregate amount of more than $19 million, a level not seen since May 2022, according to Crypto Fees. The Ethereum blockchain remains the most expensive network in terms of transaction fees at the time of writing.

Despite the latest spike in Bitcoin transaction fees, the current BTC transaction cost is still far from all-time high levels. The highest Bitcoin transaction fees were recorded in April 2021, when the average BTC transaction cost almost reached $70 amid a major decline in the Bitcoin network hash rate. The previous highest point in BTC transaction fees was in 2017, with transaction costs surging above $60.

In the United States, the White House released the national standards strategy for key and emerging technologies on May 4, identifying eight technology sectors that will have a significant economic impact in the near future.

Among the eight technologies are artificial intelligence, communication and network technologies, biotechnology and semiconductors, with the inclusion of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and digital identity infrastructure grabbing the crypto community’s attention.

DLT permits concurrent access, record validation and record updating throughout a networked database. Blockchain technology is based on DLT, making it possible for users to see any changes and the people who made them, lowering the need for auditing data, ensuring data reliability, and restricting access to only those who actually need it.

The national strategy aims to increase U.S. leadership in the development of international standards for these emerging technologies. The U.S. government is actively involved in building synergies with the private sector to promote and build international standards for such emerging technologies.

The most prominent example of such collaboration is the development of the telecom and communications standard. For example, the initial proposal for 3G was made in the 1990s by Qualcomm Technologies, with the subsequent recommendation for LTE — the dominant standard for wireless broadband communication for mobile devices and data terminals — made in the 2000s by NTT Docomo, a major Japanese mobile phone provider.

The national strategy suggests the likes of DLT and digital infrastructure would increasingly impact and be widely used in the economic sector. Some key areas where these technologies will be actively tested include automated and connected infrastructure, such as smart communities and the Internet of Things. DLT can especially find great use in building cybersecurity and privacy-based features and services.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

BTC price action rebounds from stocks slump

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView followed BTC/USD as it spiked to $29,529 on Bitstamp — a new May high.

The pair had dipped with United States equities at the Wall Street open the day prior, but the weakness was short-lived as $29,000 support returned.

Ongoing market jitters from the U.S. banking crisis, now impacting several regional banks, continued to shape observer sentiment.

“100% of all regional banks in the United States have their stocks in the red today, for the first time ever,” crypto media account Whalewire noted on Twitter.

“This comes a day after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the US banking system was stronger than ever.”

Financial commentary resource, The Kobeissi Letter, considered the potential for the fallout to continue to ripple outward.

“Today is the first day since March that markets are taking the banking crisis seriously,” it argued as stocks and crypto fell.

“S&P 500 is down over 100 points from its high this week while regional banks are at fresh lows. At first, it appeared the crisis was isolated. Perhaps this isn’t as isolated as it seemed.“

After the Federal Reserve raised interest rates this week, market expectations nonetheless pivoted to predicting an end to the hiking cycle. According to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, the next rate decision, due in mid-June, will not result in another shift higher.

Popular trader Alan, known as Trader Tardigrade, was optimistic about upside continuation, which could mimic its breakout from late 2020.

“Bitcoin has entered the phase of ‘Storing of power,’” he told Twitter followers alongside a comparative chart.

“This is for the preparation of the incoming Bull Run.”

On shorter timeframes, fellow trader Ninja set more conservative levels to return as support.

“Bulls should hold above $28.9-$29k...the quicker they reclaim above $29.2k the better,” he wrote in part of a fresh analysis.

According to a critique written by a senior software engineer at Google, the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) development is threatened by the open-source community. The engineer contends that independent researchers in open-source technology are making swift and unforeseen strides in AI technology. 

In early April, software engineer Luke Sernau published a document on an internal system. The document was subsequently shared extensively among Google employees over the next few weeks. A source, who requested anonymity as they were not permitted to discuss internal company affairs, claimed that the document had been circulated thousands of times. On Thursday, the document was published by consulting firm SemiAnalysis and began to circulate in Silicon Valley.

According to Sernau’s assessment, Google’s competition with OpenAI had diverted attention from the swift progress in open-source technology. In his document, Sernau wrote that Google had focused excessively on keeping tabs on OpenAI’s progress. While both companies struggled to outperform each other, open-source technology had quietly advanced, surpassing Google and OpenAI in the AI race.

Google is known for investing in futuristic technologies, and its labs have played a significant role in developing the current AI-powered chatbots. However, OpenAI has emerged as a frontrunner in generative AI, which involves software that can create its own images, text and videos. OpenAI’s ChatGPT was launched in November 2022 and quickly gained popularity. Its sudden success has left Google sprinting to catch up in a key technology subfield.

However, Sernau argued that open-source communities pose a real threat to Google, as engineers are developing models rivaling the quality of those at Big Tech companies at a faster pace and lower cost. According to him, these models are more customizable, faster and more useful than Google’s own models. He also worried that clients might not be willing to pay for high-quality technology when it is available for free in open-source communities.

Anyone who has dealt with trading in traditional finance is likely to be aware of profit and loss (PnL). But is PnL in the cryptocurrency world the same? The ability to comprehend terms like mark-to-market (MTM), realized PnL and unrealized PnL will help develop a better understanding of the cryptocurrency a person holds.

Without a well-defined process to get insight into profit or loss, cryptocurrency trading may be overwhelming, and traders may struggle with what they are doing. PnL reflects the change in the value of a trader’s positions over a specific period. 

To gain a clearer understanding, let's examine it in the context of cryptocurrency trading.

Understanding the basics of PnL

PnL in crypto refers to the calculation of the profit or loss made on a cryptocurrency investment or trading position. It is a metric used to evaluate the financial performance of a trader or investor in the crypto market.

To begin, here are some key terms in PnL terminology:

MTM

MTM refers to the process of valuing an asset or financial instrument based on its current market price or fair value. For example, in the context of crypto trading, if an investor holds a certain amount of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,815

, the value of that Bitcoin will fluctuate based on the current market price.

The general formula for calculating PnL is:

Suppose the MTM price for Ether 

ETH

$1,859

 today is $1,970, while the MTM price yesterday was $1,950. In this case, the PnL is $20. It indicates a profit of $20. On the contrary, if the MTM price of ETH was $1,980 yesterday, it indicates a loss of $10.

Future value

Future value indicates the value of a digital coin at a future point in time.

For example, if a trader stakes Tron 

TRX

$0.0690

 worth $1,000 with a 4% yearly reward, how much will the person get back after a year? The answer is $1,040. At the time of staking, the present value will be $1,000, while the future value will be $1,040.

There will be a present value at the point when the trader stakes, but if the person considers the future as a whole, there could be countless future values.

There is a different way to use future value as well. Traders could ask how much to stake to get $1,040 in a year. If they know the present and future values, they could calculate the discount factor. The formula for calculating the discount factor is:

For the example given above, the discount factor will be:

Realized PnL

Realized PnL is calculated after traders have closed their position (sold the cryptocurrency they hold). Only the executed price of the orders is taken into account in realized PnL, and it has no direct relation to the mark price.

The mark price is the price at which a derivatives contract is valued based on the current market price of the underlying asset rather than the price at which the contract is being traded.

The formula for realized PnL is:

An example will help understand how to calculate realized PnL. If the entry price for buying X number of Polkadot 

DOT

$5.37

 is $70 and the exit price is $105, the PnL for the period is $35, which refers to a profit of $35. However, if the closing price of the trade was $55, the PnL will be $15, but it will reflect a loss.

Unrealized PnL

Unrealized PnL refers to the profit or loss that is currently held in open positions but has not yet been realized through closing the position. The formula for determining unrealized PnL is:

Donald has purchased ETH contracts with an average entry price of $1,900. The mark price of ETH is currently $1,600. The unrealized PnL for Donald is the difference between the average entry price and the mark price.

Unrealized PnL = $1,900 - $1,600 = $300

How to do PnL calculation

To determine PnL in cryptocurrency, a trader needs to find the difference between the initial cost of acquiring a digital coin and the current market value of the same coin. Various methods to calculate PnL in cryptocurrency are as follows:

First-in, first-out (FIFO) method

The FIFO method requires the seller to use the price of the asset from when it was first bought. Here is the process to calculate PnL using the FIFO method:

1) To settle on the initial cost of the cryptocurrency, multiply the purchase price per unit by the number of units sold.

2) To determine the current market value of the asset disposed of, multiply the current market price per unit by the number of units sold.

3) To find the PnL, deduct the initial cost from the current market value.

Suppose Bob first bought 1 ETH at $1,100 and a few days later bought 1 ETH at $800. A year later, he sold 1 ETH at $1,200. As he had first bought ETH at $1,100, this price will be considered the initial cost. Applying the FIFO method, Bob could calculate PnL as follows:

Bob's initial cost = (1 ETH x $1,100) = $1,100

Current market value = (1 ETH x $1,200) = $1,200

PnL = $1,200 - $1,100 = $100 (profit)

Last-in, first-out (LIFO) method

The LIFO method requires the seller to use the most recent purchase price of an asset in the calculation. The other aspects are just like the FIFO method. Here is the PnL using the LIFO method using the same example as above:

Bob’s initial cost = (1 ETH x $800) = $800

Current market value = (1 ETH x $1,200) = $1,200

PnL = $1,200 - $800 = $400 (profit)

Weighted average cost method

The weighted average cost method requires traders to determine the average cost of all units of a digital currency in their portfolio to arrive at the initial cost. Here are the steps to calculate PnL using this method:

1) Determine the total cost of all units of the cryptocurrency. Multiply the purchase price per unit for each transaction by the number of units of the asset and add the numbers.

2) To arrive at the weighted average cost per unit of the digital coin, divide the total cost of all units by the number of units.

3) Find the current market value of the cryptocurrency sold. Multiply the current market price per unit by the number of units sold.

4) To determine PnL, subtract the average cost per unit from the current market value.

Suppose Alice bought 1 BTC at $1,500 and a few days later bought 1 BTC at $2,000. She later sold 1 BTC at $2,400. Here is the PnL using the weighted average cost method:

Total cost = (1 BTC x $1,500) + (1 BTC x $2,000) = $3,500

Weighted average cost = $3,500 / 2 BTC = $1,750

Current market value = (1 BTC x $2,400) = $2,400

PnL = $2,400 - $1,750 = $650 (profit)

Profits/losses from opening and closing positions

Analyzing open and closed positions at regular intervals is an efficient way to monitor performance. An initial purchase a person makes in the market is an open position, while selling the cryptocurrency is termed closing the position. If a trader buys 10 DOT, it is an open position. When the trader sells those DOT, the position gets closed.

For example, if a trader bought 10 DOT for $70 and sold them for $100, the person’s PnL would be $30 ($100 - $70). Regular analysis of trades in line with open and closed positions helps a person trade in an organized manner.

Year-to-date (YTD) calculation

YTD is a way to measure the performance of investments made in cryptocurrency from the start of the year to the current date. Investors who regularly buy and hold cryptocurrencies for years can know their unrealized profits with a YTD calculation. The trader just needs to calculate the value of the portfolio at the beginning and end of a year and compare these values. This could be a calendar year or fiscal year, depending on the person’s preference or requirements.

Suppose someone holds $1,000 worth of Cardano 

ADA

$0.366

 on Jan. 1, 2022 and $1,600 of ADA on Jan. 1, 2023. In this case, $600 is the unrealized profit. Unrealized profit denotes returns that haven’t yet been converted into cash or cash equivalents such as term deposits.

Transaction-based calculation

A transaction-based calculation requires a person to calculate the PnL for each specific transaction. For instance, if a person bought 1 ETH for $1,000 and sold it for $1,500, the PnL for the transaction would be $500 profit ($1,500 - $1,000). If the number of transactions is small and a trader needs to calculate PnL for these transactions separately, a transaction-based calculation is an ideal method.

Percentage profit

The percentage profit method reflects the PnL as a percentage of the initial cost. An example will help understand better. Suppose a trader buys 1 Binance Coin 

BNB

$315

 for $300 and sells it for $390. In this case, the person’s PnL would be $90 profit ($390 - $300). To arrive at the percentage profit, the trader needs to divide the PnL by the purchase price and multiply the amount by 100 (($90 / $300) x 100). This amounts to 30%.

However, please note that these are simplified examples that do not factor in variables such as taxes, trading fees paid to the platform, market volatility, etc. In real-life situations, a trader will need to take into account the specific context when calculating PnL.

How to calculate PnL of perpetual contracts

Perpetual contracts are a type of futures contract with no fixed settlement time or expiration date. Traders can hold their long or short positions indefinitely, provided they have sufficient maintenance margin, which is the minimal amount of collateral needed for maintaining open trading positions.

When traders calculate the PnL of perpetual contracts in cryptocurrencies, they need to calculate both realized and unrealized PnL and then add them to determine the total PnL.

Here are the steps to measure PnL of perpetual contracts:

Again, this is a simplified way to explain the concept of calculating PnL for crypto perpetual contracts. When calculating total PnL in real life, a trader needs to take into account factors like trading fees and funding rates.

PnL calculations and associated tools

Understanding crypto PnL helps people know if their cryptocurrency portfolio is in profit or in loss. Gaining an insight into key parameters like cost basis, quantity, price of each trade and profitability of the portfolio helps traders assess the efficiency of their strategies and make necessary adjustments. Precise knowledge of the funds they have made or lost on a particular trade influences their upcoming trading decisions for the better.

Apart from PnL calculations, there are tools like specialized spreadsheets and automated trading bots that could help traders analyze their performances and zero in on profitable trading opportunities, regardless of their experience.

The vice president of the United States and President Joe Biden’s top advisers have held a meeting with several AI industry CEOs to discuss “concerns about the risks associated with AI.”

On May 4, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris was joined by nine top Biden administration advisers in science, national security, policy and economics, meeting with the CEOs of OpenAI, Microsoft, Google and AI startup Anthropic.

Notably, tech giant Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was absent from the meeting.

Before the meeting, the White House released a flurry of AI-related announcements regarding the funding of AI research facilities, government AI policy and AI systems evaluation.

The meeting focused on the transparency of AI systems, the importance of evaluating and validating the safety of AI and ensuring AI is secured from malicious actors, according to the announcement.

Reportedly, the government and the tech CEOs agreed “more work is needed to develop and ensure appropriate safeguards and protections” for AI.

The CEOs committed to engaging with the White House to ensure Americans can “benefit from AI innovation.” No specific details were shared on what safeguards were needed or what the engagement with the government exactly entails.

Zuckerberg was absent from the meeting despite Meta working on AI for years. A White House official told CNN, “It was focused on companies currently leading in the space.”

The Biden administration also highlighted its work to address national security concerns posed by AI, specifically mentioning cybersecurity and biosecurity, without going into specifics.

It said these efforts would ensure AI firms “have access to best practices” to protect AI networks from state cybersecurity experts from the “national security community.”

White House banks big on AI

On the same day, the Biden Administration announced it would put aside $140 million to launch seven new national AI research institutes, bringing the total to 25 across the country.

“These Institutes bolster America’s AI [research and development] infrastructure,” the White House said. It added the institutes would “drive breakthroughs” in areas such as “climate, agriculture, energy, public health, education, and cybersecurity.”

In a separate announcement, the government said AI development firms including Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, NVIDIA, Hugging Face and Stability AI will also participate in publicly evaluating AI systems on a platform from AI training firm Scale AI at the hacker convention DEFCON in August.

Finally, the White House said it would release a draft policy on how the U.S. government will use AI, which will be will be made available for public comment this summer.

Policies around the development, use and procurement of AI by federal departments and agencies will be drafted. It said the policies would be a model for state and local governments in their own procurement and use of AI.

According to a shareholder letter announcing its Q1 2023 earnings, Block (NYSE:SQ) reported that its Bitcoin revenue — which counts BTC revenue as total sales of the cryptocurrency to customers — was up 18% from $1.83 billion in Q4 and 25% from Q1 2022.

Cash App’s total profits reached over $931 million in the first quarter of 2023, marking a 49% increase year-over-year. Notably, Cash App’s profit paled compared to the company’s gross profit, which came in at $1.71 billion. Block also owns the popular business payment service Square, which reported a slight (3.8%) decline in profits from the fourth quarter of 2022.

According to the shareholder letter, the multi-billion-dollar Bitcoin revenues were driven by “an increase in the quantity of Bitcoin sold to customers,” and were “partially offset” by a decrease in the market price of Bitcoin, compared to the same timeframe in 2022.

The fintech firm also reported an earning per share of 40 cents, beating analyst expectations of 35 cents per share by 14%, with its first-quarter revenue rising 26% year-on-year.

Speaking to investors in the earnings conference call, Block CEO Jack Dorsey identified both artificial intelligence and “open protocols” as technologies that would aid the company in proactively responding to the “significant shifts” in the global financial system He cited continued United States bank failures and de-dollarization as the primary culprits.

The equities market took kindly to Block’s earnings filings. The fintech firm’s share price briefly surged 5% to $63.50 in after-hours trading, before settling down to a 2.5% gain at the time of publication.

This uptick marked the first instance of relief from a steady decline in Block’s share price, which suffered a significant 25% hit following the release of a scathing report penned by famed short sellers Hindenburg Research.

On March 23, Hindenburg slammed Block for “systematically taking advantage of the demographics it claims to be helping,” and declared that Block’s success with Cash App only hinged on a “willingness to facilitate fraud against consumers and the government.”

“Hindenburg is known for these types of attacks, which are designed solely to allow short sellers to profit from a declined stock price,” wrote Block in response to Hindenburg’s allegations. “We have reviewed the full report in the context of our own data and believe it’s designed to deceive and confuse investors.”

Terraform Labs seeks to dismiss class action, arguing US laws don’t apply

Federal securities laws only apply in the United States, but the protocols were developed overseas, argues Terraform Labs.

Terraform Labs is seeking to have a class-action lawsuit against the firm dismissed, arguing the United States securities laws referenced are not applicable to its foreign-developed protocols. 

On May 3, Terraform Labs requested a California federal judge dismiss an investor suit brought by Nick Patterson that claimed the company sold unregistered securities and misled investors.

The firm’s attorneys, Dentons, argued that federal securities laws do not apply since the protocols were developed and used outside of the United States.

Excerpt from dismissal motion, Case No. 3:22-cv-03600. Source: Law360

The Terra/Luna ecosystem collapsed in May 2022, wiping out billions from the crypto markets. The crash has sparked a raft of lawsuits against the firm, associated entities such as the Luna Foundation Guard, and company founder Do Kwon.

In June 2022, this particular class action was filed, claiming that the Terra tokens — TerraUSD (UST) and LUNA — were securities, among other allegations.

According to Law360, Terraform’s dismissal motion argued that federal securities laws and the mail and wire fraud accusations in the suit only apply domestically.

“The federal securities laws do not apply because the SAC [Second Amended Complaint] does not allege that any of the protocols at issue were developed domestically.”

The same argument also applies to the suit’s RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) allegations, which claimed the firm’s goal was to reap profits at retail investors’ expense, according to Terraform.

Nick Patterson, who filed the suit on behalf of investors, did not adequately plead that mail and wire fraud allegations occurred domestically, it argued.

The motion also states that the plaintiff failed to identify the location of digital wallets containing his Terra tokens, which negates any “domestic injury” claims, according to Terraform.

Terraform and Do Kwon were sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in February, with the regulator claiming they orchestrated a multibillion-dollar securities fraud.

In April, a South Korean court ruled that LUNA was not a security under the country’s Capital Markets Act.

On April 25, Terraform Labs co-founder Hyun-seong Shin and nine individuals associated with the firm were indicted in South Korea.

They were reportedly indicted on charges of fraud, breach of trust and embezzlement and referred to trial following almost a year of investigation.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

“Too much all at once” for U.S. banks

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD losing ground as the S&P 500 shed 0.7%.

The risk asset comedown accompanied more mayhem for U.S. regional bank stocks, with PacWest Bancorp once again leading the way, falling over 50% on the day.

The embattled lender had already seen major losses and, at the time of writing, was down 86.5% year-to-date. In a statement, the bank nonetheless described its position as “solid.”

As Cointelegraph reported, reassurances of U.S. authorities over the banking system stability appeared at odds with reality for many commentators, with confusion only increasing as the crisis continued.

Within the last 24 hours:

1. PacWest Bank, $PACW, explores potential sale

2. Western Alliance Bank, $WAL, explores potential sale

3. First Horizon Bank, $FHN, cancels merger with TD Bank due to ""regulatory concerns""

4. Fed says ""banking system is sound""

5. No comment from…

— The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) May 4, 2023

“For the first time in weeks, equity markets are responding to the banking crisis,” financial commentary resource The Kobeissi Letter wrote in part of Twitter coverage.

Kobeissi argued that the latest Federal Reserve interest rate hike, confirmed as 0.25% on May 3, had added fuel to the fire.

“Perhaps this is the equity market worrying that the crisis may not isolated,” it continued.

“The Fed rate hike is only making things worse.”

In addition to PacWest, First Horizon and Western Alliance were two more major losers on the day, down 53% and 38%, respectively.

“Confidence in a financial institution is built over decades and destroyed in days,” Bill Ackman, CEO of hedge fund management firm Pershing Square, continued in his own response.

“As each domino falls, the next weakest bank begins to wobble. Until investors are rewarded for betting on a wobbling bank, there will be no bid, and the best sale is the last price. We are running out of time to fix this problem.”

In a dedicated blog post on the crisis, meanwhile, Marty Bent, founder of crypto media firm TFTC, described it as a point of no return.

“Everywhere one looks things look absolutely terrible for the US financial system. This feels like the endgame,” he warned on May 3.

“I find it hard to believe there is anything that can be done to restore confidence in the system. No amount of backstopping, money printing, buybacks, consolidation, or World Wars will be able to put this genie back in the bottle. The Fed and the Treasury will try their hardest to make the public believe otherwise, but this is simply too much all at once.”

Weekly chart underscores $28,800 BTC price significance

Turning to Bitcoin, BTC/USD found itself in an area of low liquidity at the time of writing, with large-volume traders staying away.

Related: Bitcoin miners have earned $50B from BTC block rewards, fees since 2010

Data from the Binance order book uploaded to Twitter by monitoring resource Material Indicators showed bid liquidity slowly increasing above $28,000.

As various popular traders demanded higher levels return in order to provide a shot at $30,000 resistance, longer-time takes remained optimistic.

Popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital highlighted current spot price levels as the site of an important reclaim operation.

“Last week, BTC Weekly Closed above ~$28800. And this week, $BTC has done quite well to hold it as support, in large part due to the aggressive buying in recent days,” he explained about weekly timeframes.

“Reclaim of the $28800 level is technically in progress.”

There’s a beacon of light in the bear market tunnel. The Salvadoran nonprofit program Mi Primer Bitcoin, or My First Bitcoin, has raised over 1 Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,815

 in donations — not from venture capitalists and investors but from generous Bitcoin education advocates worldwide.

Donations flooded in from countries like Venezuela, Poland and Canada as hundreds of people worldwide sent satoshis (Bitcoin’s smallest denomination) over the Lightning Network to fund the expansion of My First Bitcoin’s Bitcoin Diploma program.

We did it! We crowdfunded 1 BTC on @geyserfund in April

A matching donation from @Bitcoinbeach put us over the top last night--what a way to end the month :)

Huge THANK YOU to the 250+ donors who got us here

This is a movement that we are all part of & edu is how we will win

— Mi Primer Bitcoin (@MyfirstBitcoin_) May 1, 2023

Cointelegraph reached out to John Dennehy, founder of My First Bitcoin, to understand how the crowdfunding campaign reached 1 BTC in less than three weeks. Dennehy told Cointelegraph, “Bitcoin’s greatest potential is empowering the individual, and making it easy to donate value is a big part of that.”

“Bitcoin crowdfunding makes it possible for anyone to participate, which is revolutionary when compared to the existing fiat system that restricts who can participate. This is a way to level the playing field.”

Unlike PayPal or GoFundMe, Bitcoin’s censorship-resistant, self-sovereign properties make it one of the most efficient ways to send money online. Plus, it’s far cheaper. Money is sent over the layer-2 Lightning Network, which costs a fraction of legacy payment services. Dennehy explained:

“Bitcoin crowdfunding is an example of how Bitcoin allows people to take control of their own money.”

The crowdfunding campaign was boosted by the efforts of Bitcoin Beach, the Bitcoin circular community in El Zonte on El Salvador’s Pacific coast. Bitcoin Beach was the spark that led to BTC being declared legal tender in El Salvador in 2021. On April 27, Bitcoin Beach declared it would match all donations to the project until midnight on April 27:

— Bitcoin Beach (@Bitcoinbeach) April 27, 2023

Regardless, the campaign had begun with lightning-fast levels of generosity. MetaMick, the founder of Bitcoin crowdfunding platform Geyser — which My First Bitcoin used for its fundraiser — told Cointelegraph, “Definitely the biggest educational project on Geyser ever! Insane traction in just a day!” He added that it was the third-largest crowdfund ever on Geyser after just one day.

Despite Bitcoin’s price grinding lower — and wiping out traders — the Bitcoin community continues to build and educate. As Dennehy summed up:

“We are inspired every day by the support we receive from the Bitcoin community. We couldn’t do what we do without it.”

To date, My First Bitcoin has educated 6,000 students in El Salvador. Cointelegraph attended its second graduation ceremony in San Marcos in November 2021.

MARKET ANALYSIS
Join us on social networks

For the past 14 days, cryptocurrency markets have been trading within an unusually tight 7.1% range. In other words, investors are unwilling to place new bets until there’s additional regulatory clarity, especially in the United States.

The total crypto market capitalization fell by 1% to $1.2 trillion over the seven days ending May 4, primarily as a result of Bitcoin’s

Notice that the exact same $1.16 trillion–$1.22 trillion total market capitalization range previously stood for 12 days between March 29 and April 10. The conflicting forces: regulatory uncertainty weighing it down and the banking crisis pushing prices upward are likely the reason for the lack of risk appetite on both sides.

SEC’s crypto crackdown could backfire

The Coinbase exchange, for instance, has been battling the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the need for clear rules for trading digital assets. The stakes were raised after the exchange was handed a Wells notice, a “legal threat” for “possible violations of securities laws,” on March 22.

However, the latest decision has been favorable to Coinbase, as the court has instructed the SEC to clarify the security rules for digital assets within 10 days.

On the other hand, the banking crisis seems not to have faded after the lender PacWest Bancorp reportedly announced that it was considering a buyout. The regional financial institution held $40 billion in assets, although some 80% of the loan book is dedicated to commercial real estate and residential mortgages — a sector that has been plagued by rising interest rates.

The recent crypto sideways trend suggests that investors are hesitant to place new bets until there’s more clarity on whether the U.S. Treasury will continue injecting liquidity to contain the banking crisis, which favors inflation and positive momentum for scarce assets.

BTC, ETH derivatives show muted demand from bears

Perpetual contracts, also known as inverse swaps, have an embedded rate that is usually charged every eight hours. Exchanges use this fee to avoid exchange risk imbalances.

A positive funding rate indicates that longs (buyers) demand more leverage. However, the opposite situation occurs when shorts (sellers) require additional leverage, causing the funding rate to turn negative.

The seven-day funding rate for Bitcoin and Ether was neutral, indicating balanced demand from leveraged longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) using perpetual futures contracts. BNB was the only exception, as shorts have been paying 1.4% per week to keep their positions open indicating bearishness.

To exclude externalities that might have solely impacted futures markets, traders can gauge the market’s sentiment by measuring whether more activity is going through call (buy) options or put (sell) options. Generally speaking, call options are used for bullish strategies, whereas put options are used for bearish ones.

The expiration of options can have a significant impact on the market, particularly if there are a large number of contracts involved. When options contracts expire, the holders of these contracts may choose to exercise their rights, which can result in buying or selling pressure on the underlying asset. This can lead to increased volatility in the price of Bitcoin, which resulted in a $575-million advantage for bulls in the latest April 28 expiry.

A 0.70 put-to-call ratio indicates that put option open interest lags the more bullish calls and is, therefore, bullish. In contrast, a 1.40 indicator favors put options, which can be deemed bearish.

BTC options volume put-to-call ratio. Source: Laevitas.ch

The put-to-call ratio for Bitcoin options volume has been below 0.90 since April 26, indicating a higher preference for neutral-to-bullish call options. More importantly, even as Bitcoin briefly corrected down to $27,700 on May 1, there was no significant surge in demand for the protective put options.

Traders pricing low odds of a break above $1.2 trillion

The options market shows whales and market makers unwilling to take protective puts even after Bitcoin crashed 7.8% on May 1. However, given the balanced demand on futures markets, traders seem hesitant to place additional bets until there’s clarity on whether the U.S. Treasury will continue to bail out the troubled regional bank sector.

It is unclear whether the total market capitalization will be able to break through the $1.22-trillion barrier. But one thing is for sure: Professional traders are not betting on a crypto price crash, given that the demand for protective puts has been muted.

In episode 18 of Cointelegraph’s Hashing It Out podcast, Elisha Owusu Akyaw sits down with Matt Leisinger, chief product officer at Alluvial — a software development company supporting the implementation of the Liquid Collective protocol — to explore the world of crypto staking and its potential to attract institutional investors. Leisinger explains the Liquid Collective and shares his thoughts on the future of Ether

 staking after the Shanghai upgrade. 

Matt Leisinger started his carrier in the traditional finance sector and shifted to trading cryptocurrencies in 2016. Leisinger invested in the Ethereum ecosystem and contributed to projects providing liquid staking services. Leisinger explains liquid staking as allowing users to stake assets on the blockchain and mint a receipt token that represents the staked assets, which maintains liquidity while users earn rewards and secure the network.

As institutional investment in cryptocurrency skyrockets, some are looking at ways to add staking to their portfolio. According to Leisinger, most of these firms would naturally choose liquid staking, but hurdles around Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements, transparency, tokenholder privileges, and counter-party risks must first be dealt with. Leisinger explains that Alluvial provides a solution for enterprises by dealing with these hurdles that slow down adoption.

On regulations, Leisinger says that firms like Alluvial “really want” regulatory clarity. According to him, there are two types of staking: direct staking and actively managed staking. Both have different implications from a regulatory perspective around token ownership, security and transparency. Leisinger believes liquid staking is better positioned to withstand regulatory pressure due to its transparency.

What’s more, Leisinger admits that a lack of regulatory clarity has had a chilling effect on institutional staking. Nevertheless, the Alluvial exec is optimistic that new milestones like the Ethereum Shapella upgrade will derisk participation in staking and attract interest.

Gold, Bitcoin benefit from U.S. banking mayhem

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked a swift mood change for BTC/USD, which hit $29,242 on Bitstamp.

The pair had sunk to daily lows at the previous day’s Wall Street open as markets awaited the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates.

At the same time, more U.S. regional bank stocks were suffering, with the trend remaining as the Fed confirmed its much-anticipated 0.25% hike.

One lender, PacWest Bancorp, reportedly announced that it was considering a buyout, pressuring the regional bank sector even further while boosting havens, including Bitcoin.

Gold even hit new all-time highs as market commentators criticized the Fed’s approach and predicted the end of rate hikes altogether.

“The biggest joke is the fact that Jerome Powell says that the banking system has improved and is healthy, sound and resilient. It’s the weakest it has ever been and another few banks have been falling apart after market,” Michaël van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight, reacted.

“This was the last hike.”

Van de Poppe referenced comments on the regional banking sector by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which accompanied the rate decision.

“Conditions in that sector have broadly improved since early March, and the U.S banking system is sound and resilient,” he said in a statement prior to a subsequent press conference.

“We will continue to monitor conditions in this sector. We are committed to learning the right lessons from this episode and will work to prevent events like these from happening again.”

Others were far from convinced, however.

Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of derivatives exchange BitMEX, revealed that he was already hunting for failing regional banks. Markets, he argued, could depend on the next move by either Powell or Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

“You never know what is the trigger that causes Yellen or Powell to cave and bail everyone out. It’s all politics now and politics is more about power than rational decisions,” part of a tweet read.

Financial commentator Tedtalksmacro additionally noted that the Fed funds rate was now at its members’ own expected peak.

An “important signal”

Turning to Bitcoin: reclaiming $29,000 provided a much-needed bullish counterpoint to recent price action.

Eyeing changes in the Binance order book, monitoring resource Material Indicators showed that whale buying power had gained the upper hand through the news events.

“After clearing out most of liquidity in the range before the FOMC FED rate hike announcement, BTC whales had no problem eating through the remaining liquidity and reclaimed $29k,” it summarized.

Market participants thus hoped that further liquidity squeezes could come next, fueling a trip above the $30,000 barrier.

“Even though Gold is attacking ATHs, Bitcoin continues to outperform it,“ Checkmate, lead on-chain analyst at Glassnode, noted, having called gold’s new highs an “important signal.“

A tweet including Glassnode data showed the increase in BTC/XAU since the start of 2020.

Mainstream media renew push for non-US FTX user identities

A May 3 filing to the United States Bankruptcy Court brings new objections to a motion that aimed to redact customer identities.

Four media outlets in the United States have continued efforts to get the identities of non-U.S. FTX customers revealed, filing new objections to a previous motion to seal their identities. 

Bloomberg, Dow Jones, The New York Times and the Financial Times first filed a motion objecting to FTX and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors being authorized to redact and withhold customer information on Jan 11.

While the court previously had heard similar arguments by the four firms, the May 3 filing made a new objection to the Committee’s motion to seal the identities of non-U.S. customers.

The media outlet's most recent argument is that there is no legal basis to redact the names pursuant to non-U.S. data privacy laws.

The media giants argued that under section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code — the provision which grants the bankruptcy court judicial power — there is no part that permits foreign law to override the right of access to information under U.S. constitutional and statutory law:

“At bottom, Movants desire to avoid ‘enforcement of the public disclosure requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law’ [...] furnishes no basis for sealing.”

“The law of the United States — constitutional and statutory — guarantees the public a strong presumptive right to inspect bankruptcy filings. That right cannot be abrogated by a party’s assertion of legal obligations under foreign law,” the media firms added.

The first argument raised — which was claimed in an earlier filing — was that the names of FTX’s creditors do not constitute “confidential commercial information.”

The second — also raised in an earlier filing — is that such disclosure wouldn’t subject the creditors to “undue risk.”

FTX and the committee have until May 4 at 4:00 pm Eastern Time to submit an objection.

The hearing date for the filing will take place on May 17 at 1:00pm.

The Bitcoin price successfully defended the $28,000 support on May 2, but it has yet to prove the strength needed to reclaim the $29,200 level from April 30.

$30K becomes crucial for Bitcoin bulls

Some analysts will pin the recent downtrend on the expectation of an interest rate increase by the United States Federal Reserve on May 3, but in reality, the market is pricing 92% odds of a modest 25-basis-point increase to its highest level since September 2007.

As the market intelligence platform Decentrader pointed out, the comments from Fed chairman Jerome Powell are more likely to bring surprise elements, either pointing to further measures to slow down the economy or signaling higher odds of the terminal interest rate being close to 5%. Powell is set to hold a press conference at 2:30 pm Eastern Time.

From an employment perspective, the central bank has reason to believe that the market continues to be overheated. The U.S. government reported 1.6 job openings for every unemployed worker in March. Moreover, according to the “ADP National Employment Report” released on May 3, private payrolls increased by 296,000 jobs in April, well above the 148,000 market consensus.

However, raising interest rates has negative consequences for families and small businesses in particular. Financing and mortgages become more costly, while investing in fixed income becomes more attractive. Such an undesired effect of curbing inflation could further shake the core of the financial system as shown by the latest bank failure, this time of First Republic Bank.

Therefore, an eventual Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,815

 price breakthrough above $30,000 could be a definitive sign of investors’ perception shifting from seeing Bitcoin as a risk asset to a scarce digital asset that directly benefits from a weaker traditional banking system.

But to gauge whether Bitcoin’s resilience above $28,000 is sustainable, an investor must analyze if excessive leverage has been used by buyers and whether professional traders are pricing higher odds of a market downturn using BTC derivatives.

Bitcoin futures show low demand from leverage buyers

Bitcoin quarterly futures are popular among whales and arbitrage desks. However, these fixed-month contracts typically trade at a slight premium to spot markets, indicating that sellers are asking for more money to delay settlement.

As a result, futures contracts in healthy markets should trade at a 5 to 10% annualized premium — a situation known as contango, which is not unique to crypto markets.

The data suggests Bitcoin traders have been extra cautious over the past couple of weeks. Even as the BTC price flirted with $30,000 on April 26, there were no signs of demand for leveraged longs.

Moreover, the Bitcoin futures premium has stagnated near 2% since April 23, suggesting that buyers are unwilling to use leverage, which is healthy for the market. By avoiding futures contract exposure, it greatly reduces the risk of large liquidations during negative Bitcoin price moves.

Bitcoin options traders remain neutral

The Bitcoin options market can also help a trader understand whether a recent correction has caused investors to become more optimistic. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign when arbitrage desks and market makers overcharge for upside or downside protection.

In short, if traders anticipate a Bitcoin price drop, the skew metric will rise above 7%, and phases of excitement tend to have a negative 7% skew.

The option delta's 25% skew has shown balanced demand between call and put options for the past four weeks. That should come as a surprise given that the Bitcoin price rallied 10% between April 25 and April 30, when it last tested the $30,000 resistance.

Consequently, Bitcoin options and futures markets suggest that professional traders are not placing their chips on the BTC price breaking above $30,000 anytime soon. On the other hand, those whales are pricing in similar odds of surprise positive and negative moves.

Ultimately, given that the Fed clearly has a limit to raising interest rates without causing a recession, Bitcoin’s price should be positively impacted, regardless of the decision on May 3.

Fed chair Powell will ultimately force the U.S. Treasury to inject more money into the economy to contain the banking crisis, which will be beneficial for a scarce asset such as Bitcoin.

French Senate proposal would allow influencers to promote cryptocurrency

The Senate’s proposal comes just months after the National Assembly floated legislation banning influencer advertising for crypto products and services.

The French Senate’s Committee on Economic Affairs recently approved an amendment to pending legislation allowing registered cryptocurrency companies to hire social media influencers for advertising and promotional purposes.

According to a translation of the amendment provided by Bing, the new wording would allow companies that are registered with France’s Financial Markets Authority (AMF) to hire influencers for their products:

“The current wording is more restrictive than the existing provisions in the Consumer Code, since it excludes the possibility for digital asset service providers (PSAN) registered with the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) to use commercial influence. Consequently, this amendment introduces this possibility for PSANs registered or approved with the AMF.”

In its original iteration, the bill in question called for what essentially amounted to an outright ban on influencer advertising for the crypto industry in France. Its wording limited the companies who could engage in influencer advertising to only those licensed by the AMF, a bar no cryptocurrency company currently meets.

As Paris-based law firm Beaubourg Avocats points out in an educational blog post, ""France has established a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency that primarily relies on two regimes: the token sale or ICO (Initial Coin Offering) visa and the Digital Assets Service Providers ('DASPs') registration and license.”

All cryptocurrency companies operating in France are legally required to register with the AMF. So far, none have received the necessary licensing that would allow them to hire influencers to promote their products in the nation legally.

Related: France mulls fast-tracking registered crypto firms to new EU rules

The change of language in the amendment would eliminate the licensing requirement and thus allow companies that are simply registered with the AMF to pay influencers for promotion on social media.

Crypto Twitter appears to be hailing the news as a positive step for the French influencer and cryptocurrency markets.

⚡️ La commission des affaires éco du @Senat adopte une nouvelle version de la #PPLinfluenceurs :

➡️ PSAN enregistrés et émetteurs d’ICO pourront continuer d'être promus
➡️ les activités #Crypto hors champ PSAN (NFT, DeFi...) également

Une étape cruciale avant l'adoption ? pic.twitter.com/i9HpJQlO7H

— Adan (@adan_asso) May 3, 2023

It does however bear mention that the change hasn’t been officially ratified yet. Along with a series of other revisions, the proposed amendment must pass through the full Senate in a plenary meeting before it faces approval by the National Assembly.

PRICE ANALYSIS
Join us on social networks

Investors seem to have priced in a 25-basis-points rate hike by the United States Federal Reserve on May 3. Next, they will look for clues on the Fed’s actions for the rest of the year.

Will the Fed maintain its hawkish stance as inflation still remains well above its target range, or will the bank troubles and looming recession make the central bank signal a pause in its rate hikes?

The World Economic Forum's “Chief Economists Outlook” report released on May 1 shows that 80% of the chief economists surveyed believe that central banks have to maintain a delicate balance between “managing inflation and maintaining financial sector stability.” The economists anticipate that the central banks will find it difficult to bring down inflation to their target levels.

In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX, cautioned investors that investing in assets “outside of the traditional financial system” is the only way out if they want to preserve their capital.

Could Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,782

 and altcoins start an up-move after bouncing off key support levels? Let’s study the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

Bitcoin price analysis

The price action of the past few days has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern in Bitcoin. Generally, a symmetrical triangle acts as a continuation pattern and the price breaks out in the direction that was prevalent before the formation developed.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, it is better to wait for the price to complete the breakout before waging any new bets because sometimes, the setup behaves as a reversal pattern.

The flattish 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($28,642) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.

If the price continues lower and breaks below the triangle, it will suggest the start of a short-term corrective phase. The BTC/USDT pair may drop to $25,250. This level is likely to witness aggressive buying by the bulls.

Contrarily, if the price bounces off the support line and breaks above the 20-day EMA, the pair may rise to the resistance line. A break and close above the triangle will open the doors for a potential rally to $32,400.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

Ether price analysis

Ether 

ETH

$1,856

 jumped off the support line of the symmetrical triangle pattern on May 1, indicating that lower levels are attracting buyers.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls will try to push the price above the moving averages and challenge the resistance line. If buyers kick the price above the triangle, the ETH/USDT pair may rally to $2,131. There is minor resistance at $2,000, but it is likely to be crossed.

Contrarily, if the price turns down from the current level, the bears will make another attempt to sink the pair below the triangle. If they succeed in their endeavor, the pair may plunge to the pattern target of $1,619.

BNB price analysis

BNB

 remains stuck inside the symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

Buyers are trying to guard the support line of the triangle. If they manage to push the price above the 20-day EMA ($326), the BNB/USDT pair could rise to the resistance line. Traders will have to overcome this obstacle to signal the start of a new up-move.

Alternatively, if the price collapses below the triangle, it will suggest that the uncertainty has resolved in favor of the bears. The pair may then slide to $300 and thereafter extend the fall to the pattern target of $280.

XRP price analysis

The long tail on the May 1 and 2 candlesticks shows that the bulls tried to start a recovery in XRP 

XRP

$0.42

. However, they could not sustain the buying pressure, and the price turned lower on May 3.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears will try to extend the decline to the strong support at $0.43. This remains the key level to watch for in the near term. If this support crumbles, the XRP/USDT pair may drop to $0.36. This level is likely to attract aggressive buying by the bulls.

Instead, if the price turns up from $0.43 and breaks above the 20-day EMA ($0.47), it will signal that bulls are on a comeback. The pair could then rally to the resistance line. If buyers surmount this hurdle, the pair may surge to $0.54.

Cardano price analysis

The bulls held Cardano’s ADA 

ADA

$0.365

 above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($0.38) on May 2, but they failed to overcome the obstacle at the 20-day EMA ($0.39).

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears are trying to pounce on this opportunity and close the ADA/USDT pair below the 50-day SMA. There is minor support at $0.37, but if that cracks, the selling could pick up momentum, and the pair may slump to $0.33 and later to $0.30.

The important resistance on the upside is the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. Buyers will have to drive the price above this level to signal a potential trend change in the near term. The pair can then surge to $0.46.

Dogecoin price analysis

Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

 is struggling to bounce off the strong support near $0.08, which suggests a lack of demand from the bulls.

DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($0.08) is sloping down, and the RSI is below 42, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the support near $0.08 is breached, the DOGE/USDT pair could plummet to the next major support at $0.07.

If bulls want to prevent this decline, they will have to quickly push the price above the downtrend line. The pair may then rally to $0.09 and thereafter dash toward the stiff overhead resistance at $0.11.

Polygon price analysis

Polygon’s MATIC 

MATIC

$0.8812

 rebounded off the $0.94 support on May 2, indicating that the bulls are trying to aggressively protect the level.

MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($1.02) is sloping down, and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating that the sentiment remains negative. Sellers will try to stall the recovery at the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, the MATIC/USDT pair may turn down and fall to $0.94.

The repeated retest of a support level within a short interval tends to weaken it. If this support gives way, the selling could intensify, and the pair may nosedive to $0.69. Buyers will have to kick the price above the resistance line to invalidate the bearish view.

Solana price analysis

Buyers defended the 50-day SMA ($21.78) on May 2, but they could not propel Solana’s SOL 

SOL

$21

 above the 20-day EMA ($22.26). This shows that the bears are selling on every minor rally.

SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bears have pulled the price below the 50-day SMA. If they sustain the breakdown, the SOL/USDT pair could reach the next strong support at $18.70. The possibility of a bounce off this level remains high. If that happens, the pair may stay range-bound between $18.70 and $27.12 for some more time.

Contrarily, if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are attempting a comeback. The pair could then rally to $24 and later dash to the overhead resistance at $27.12.

Polkadot price analysis

Polkadot’s DOT 

DOT

$5.36

 slipped below the $5.70 support on May 1, and the bears are trying to build upon this advantage on May 3.

DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls attempted a recovery on May 2, but the shallow bounce showed a lack of aggressive buying near $5.70. This suggests that the DOT/USDT pair may continue lower and reach the crucial support at $5.15.

Time is running out for the bulls. If they want to start a sustained recovery, they will have to quickly push the price above the moving averages. If they manage to do that, the pair may pick up momentum and rally toward $7.

Litecoin price analysis

Litecoin 

LTC

$79.62

 is getting squeezed between the 20-day EMA ($89) and the horizontal support at $85. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover, and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating that bears hold the edge.

LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If bears tug the price below $85, the selling could intensify, and the LTC/USDT pair may plunge to the strong support at $75. The bulls are expected to defend this level with all their might because a break below it will open the doors for a further drop to $65.

Another possibility is that the price rebounds off the current level and rises above the moving averages. Such a move will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The pair may then rise to $96 and above it to $106.

Artificial intelligence (AI) brings yet another industry into a hot debate over its usage as Hollywood and the greater media industry faces petitions from the Writers Guild of America (WGA).

The WGA recently sent out a list of demands that included the regulation of AI usage on the minimum basic agreement (MBA) covered projects. It stated that AI should not be used to write or rewrite literary material nor be used as source material.

Additionally, it demanded that MBA-covered material can’t be used in training AI. In its initial statement back in March, the guild wrote:

“The WGA’s proposal to regulate use of material produced using artificial intelligence or similar technologies ensures the Companies can’t use AI to undermine writers’ working standards including compensation, residuals, separated rights and credits.”

However, Hollywood studios have officially rejected the demands and countered with an offer of “annual meetings to discuss advancements in technology.”

This issue pertaining to AI usage was one of many, including compensation and working conditions, that pushed the WGA to go on an authorized strike in Los Angeles on May 2 for the first time in 15 years. 

Ellen Stutzman, the chief negotiator for the WGA, called the proposal “reasonable” and said that AI should be kept “out of the business of writing television and movies.” She also commented that some members of the guild had penned the name “plagiarism machine” for AI.

AI tools are already being implemented in Hollywood for touching up visuals and de-aging actors’ appearances, among other things. 

Hollywood production studios’ stance of openness to emerging technologies, such as AI, differs from the stance of major companies in other creative industries like the music industry.

The initial response of Universal Music Group after AI-generated music started popping up on streaming services was a manhunt to get them removed, along with lawsuits. Though some artists themselves with established names in the industry are encouraging the usage of the technology.

Fed set to hike into banking crisis

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching $28,152 on Bitstamp, down 2.2% from the day’s highs.

The pair continued volatility into the May 3 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the event that accompanies interest rate adjustments.

As Cointelegraph reported, market sentiment has priced in a 90%+ chance of the Fed hiking 0.25% to copy its March moves, with little expectations of a surprise instead.

The odds of the hike materializing stood at 83% at the time of writing, according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, around 15% lower than the previous day.

As in March, however, the Fed would be hiking into a banking crisis exacerbated by already high interest rates. Multiple United States regional bank stocks fell considerably the day prior, raising concerns that the crisis has gone nowhere.

“The regional bank sector, KRE, just posted its 3rd biggest daily drop of this crisis, falling nearly 7%. Yet, we still have not received any comment from the FDIC or Fed,” financial commentary resource, The Kobeissi Letter, told Twitter followers on the day.

“In fact, the Fed is expected to RAISE interest rates again today. Meanwhile, no major headlines are reporting on the crisis anymore. The lack of attention to what’s happening to our system is incredibly concerning.”

Kobeissi referred to the U.S. SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF, down over 30% year-to-date.

Arthur Hayes, former CEO of crypto derivatives giant BitMEX, held a similarly bleak view, predicting the downfall of several regional banks this week in a copycat move following the shutdown of First Republic Bank at the weekend.

“PACW indicating down 10%. Oh Baby! Will they make it to Friday or does the Fed have a surprise do us?” he queried in a subsequent tweet.

“Isn’t it great there is such a resilient banking system in Pax Americana?”
Little hope of a Bitcoin price breakout

Despite the banking angst, Bitcoin remained aloof, failing to capitalize on sentiment and remaining firmly within an established trading range.

“No doubt that BTC has lost some momentum. It’s currently ranging and whatever happens from here on out will determine the market structure and likely the next bigger move,” popular trader Daan Crypto Trades summarized.

“Above $30K would continue the bullish trend. Below $27K would make for a bearish market structure.”

Fellow trader Pentoshi revealed a downside target of around $25,000 for his next potential trade, while Elizy offered two zones closer to spot price at which he would “pull the trigger.”

Trader Crypto-ROD, meanwhile, shared a more optimistic short-term BTC/USD roadmap.

Firm bullishness, however, was hard to find among commentators, with trader Justin Bennett noting decreasing volume as a telltale warning sign of flagging upside potential.

“I’d love to know how so many believe Bitcoin will reach $100k or even $50k this year when volume looks like this,” he argued on May 2.

“A rally on decreasing volume = exhaustion.”

Layer-1 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain platform Flare has integrated its application programming interface (API) portal on Google Cloud Marketplace, onboarding a number of significant blockchain APIs to the ecosystem.

The integration of Google Cloud Marketplace will provide high-integrity blockchain data from Flare nodes and connected chain nodes to a large pool of developers and users of the software products and services platform. This includes blockchain APIs for Algorand, BNB Smart Chain, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Flare, Litecoin, Songbird, XRP ledger and future-supported blockchain APIs.

Blockchain APIs are touted to free developers from having to run their own nodes for the respective blockchains they are interacting with. The data supplied powers applications that execute transactions and query the latest state of a blockchain by calling up on-chain data.

Flare highlights blockchain APIs as valuable for building cross-chain applications that query various data sources, including major cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets that use its API portal.

A statement from Flare’s vice president of engineering Josh Edwards highlighted that the provision of blockchain APIs to platforms like Google Cloud Marketplace will play a role in increased Web3 participation:

“It makes it easier for developers to experiment with blockchain technology and its many use cases without being burdened by onerous hardware costs and ongoing maintenance.”

Edwards also suggested that larger organizations and partners making use of Google Cloud Marketplace would potentially experiment with the secure and approved Web3 APIs.

The EVM-based layer 1 aims to extend the utility of blockchain technology by providing data from various chains and Web2 sources, which could climb to over 100 chains that form Flare’s oracle.

Flare’s integration comes just days after Polygon Labs and Google Cloud announced a multiyear partnership for the cloud computing service provider to boost the Ethereum scaling protocol’s tools and infrastructure development.

The deal sees Google Cloud’s framework and developer tools provided to Polygon’s core protocols, aimed at fostering the development of Web3 products and decentralized applications on Polygon.

Google Cloud’s partnership with the ecosystem is expected to advance Polygon’s zero-knowledge development. Testing of Polygon zkEVM’s zero-knowledge proofs on Google Cloud reportedly resulted in faster and cheaper transactions compared to the existing infrastructure available.

New Cosmos chain will use liquid staking tokens from other networks for security

Staked ETH, BNB, ATOM, SOL and MATIC will be usable on Tenet as “restakes” to gain further rewards.

A new Cosmos-based blockchain called “Tenet'' will use liquid staking coins from other networks to secure its transactions, potentially allowing the new network to inherit the security of older ones, according to a May 3 announcement from the developers. 

The network is currently available as a testnet and will launch a mainnet version as soon as testing is complete. This comes after liquid staking has recently become the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol category.

Liquid staking protocols such as Lido, Rocket Pool and Ankr allow users to stake their coins with a network of validators and receive rewards without having to run their own nodes. These protocols also provide users with tokens called “liquid staking derivatives,” or LSDs, redeemable for the underlying deposits and rewards.

According to the announcement, Tenet will allow users to “restake” these LSDs to earn additional rewards on its network. And it will provide users with tokens that represent the LSDs themselves. The team calls these third-order tokens “liquid liquid staking derivatives,” or LLSDs. LLSDs will be usable in lending apps and decentralized exchanges throughout the Tenet network, the announcement said.

The team expects there to be two core benefits to using LSDs instead of a native coin to secure the network. First, it “ensures the long-term security of the Tenet chain by leveraging the joint security of each [layer 1] ecosystem it services.” Second, it should “bring additional liquidity and yield opportunities to LSDs.”

 to be restaked on Tenet.

The new network is being developed by former executives of Ankr and Blockdaemon and is advised by members of the Lido, Ankr and OpenAI teams.

Liquid staking protocols have existed since 2020 when Lido was first launched. They grew in popularity in 2022 and early 2023 as the Ethereum network implemented a move to proof-of-stake and began to allow staking withdrawals. On May 1, crypto analytics platform DefiLlama announced that liquid staking had become the top category of DeFi apps when measured by total value locked.

Some experts have argued that liquid staking may grow in the future as a result of the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade.

Bitcoin’s BRC-20 token standard has become the latest trend in the crypto ecosystem, especially after the Pepe (PEPE) memecoin rise in recent months. A total of 8,500 different tokens have been minted using the BRC-20 standard, with the majority of these BRC-20 tokens being memecoins, such as PEPE and Memetic (MEME).

BRC-20 is an experimental token standard on the Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,782

 blockchain modeled on Ethereum’s ERC-20. It allows programmers to create and send fungible tokens via the Ordinals protocol.

Although modeled after ERC-20, the BRC-20 token standard fundamentally differs from its Ethereum-based counterpart. BRC-20 tokens don’t make use of smart contracts. The token standard also requires a Bitcoin wallet to mint and trade these tokens.

The BRC-20 token standard was created early in March by an anonymous on-chain analyst called Domo. The objective was to make it possible for fungible tokens to be issued and transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain. The market cap of BRC-20 tokens has exploded over the past month and currently sits at $120 million, a 600% rise in the past week.

The BRC-20 token frenzy has also dwarfed the blockchain’s original number of Bitcoin transactions. The number of BRC-20 transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain between April 29 and May 2 reached over 50%, outperforming regular BTC transactions.

The BRC-20 token volume peaked on May 1 at 366,000 transactions, with the total number of transactions on the network being 2.36 million.

Along with the rise in BRC-20 transactions, transaction fees have surged due to the new token activity. Since its inception in late April, the network has generated an additional 109.7 BTC in transaction fees for miners.

The memecoin frenzy has been a notable topic on the Ethereum blockchain, but with the rise of the BRC-20 standard, a similar trend is also observed on the Bitcoin blockchain. The memecoin craze has also led to a significant rise in Ethereum network gas fees, contributing to network congestion.

Artificial intelligence (AI) continues its pervasive entry into industries worldwide. The latest crypto industry adoptee is Crypto.com, which announced its new generative AI user assistant.

Crypto.com announced “Amy” on May 2. The crypto exchange’s new AI companion is built to inform users about the industry, including real-time token prices and projects, historical events, and more. According to the announcement, Amy, which uses ChatGPT as its base, is currently in the pilot phase to “gather learnings” before future expansion.

Abhi Bisarya, the executive vice president of product at Crypto.com, says the company is “bullish” on the usage of AI in crypto.

“As with other businesses and sectors, we see incredible potential and opportunity in the convergence of AI with the crypto industry and our platform specifically.”

A Crypto.com spokesperson told Cointelegraph that although these are the “early days” of generative AI, there is potential for “massive positive implications” for many industries if done responsibly.

“This is particularly the case for crypto when it comes to helping educate users about the underlying technology and financial services more broadly.“

As for drawbacks, the spokesperson said they expect a lot of feedback from this AI pilot, which will be “integrated into future upgrades.“

 miners have profited roughly 37% from mining Bitcoin since its inception, new data reveals.

Calculations from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode suggest that since 2010, fees and block reward subsidies have netted miners over $50 billion.

Bitcoin miner revenue passes $50 billion mark

Amid an ongoing debate over miner costs and susceptibility to Bitcoin price dips, new figures suggest that miners are firmly in the black in the long term.

According to Glassnode, miners’ total all-time income is almost 40% higher than their estimated costs, coming in at $50.2 billion versus $36.6 billion, respectively.

Researchers generated the numbers using two metrics: thermocap and transaction fees, which are “the cumulative sum of issuance multiplied by spot price in addition to all-time generated fee revenue” and difficulty production cost.

In a dedicated report in late March, Glassnode explained the nuances behind the calculations while arriving at the 37% profit margin still in place today.

“In this model, the Thermocap and Transaction Fees can be considered the realized revenue by miners, whilst the Difficulty Production Cost is considered the aggregate mining input expense,” the report explains.

The results counter fears that too low a BTC/USD price could spark mass capitulation across the mining industry, which continues to grow.

Bitcoin network fundamentals support the argument, with difficulty and hash rate both hitting new all-time highs throughout 2023.

Current estimates from BTC.com, however, predict that this week’s difficulty adjustment will be the first negative one for Bitcoin since mid-February, 2023.

Meanwhile, an influx of newly-created unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) thanks to ordinals is rapidly making on-chain transactions less appealing this month.

In an announcement sent to Cointelegraph, Bitdeer and DHI said they would launch the partnership by creating a closed-end fund with an approximate value of $500 million. The firms aim to start their fundraising efforts at the end of May to attract investments from around the world.

Bitdeer chairman Jihan Wu expressed enthusiasm about collaborating with DHI. According to Wu, the company will work with DHI to utilize Bhutan’s zero-emission energy to support blockchain technologies, which will eventually establish an unchangeable foundation for a universal store of value. He also added that the fund would provide a platform to develop international stakeholder networks that will contribute to Bhutan’s tech sector.

Meanwhile, DHI CEO Ujjwal Deep Dahal also expressed enthusiasm about collaborating with Bitdeer on the project. He explained that DHI’s goal is to enhance the lives of Bhutanese people and believes that the partnership with Bitdeer is a step toward a more sustainable domestic economy. 

The partnership is expected to create employment opportunities in various fields, including engineering, project management, and supervisory and supportive roles. Moreover, it is expected to stimulate economic growth and generate revenue in foreign currency for the local community and the country.

On April 17, it was revealed in court documents that the Kingdom of Bhutan was quietly investing millions in cryptocurrencies. Bhutan grew a crypto portfolio through its sovereign investment arm DHI without disclosing it to the public. The funds were discovered in the Celsius and BlockFi bankruptcy process.

Following the revelation of its secret investments, it was also discovered that the Himalayan kingdom has been mining Bitcoin using hydropower since April 2019, when Bitcoin

UK government targets fraudsters with new ban on cold calls for crypto

The U.K. government plans to introduce laws to reimburse victims of authorized crypto fraud and work with Ofcom to prevent phone number “spoofing.“

The United Kingdom is set to ban cold calls selling financial products, including insurance and cryptocurrencies, to crack down on fraud. The National Crime Agency estimates that fraud costs the country approximately £7 billion ($8.7 billion) annually. 

The U.K. government announced its new fraud strategy, pledging 400 new jobs to update its approach to intelligence-led policing. The government will work alongside the telecoms regulator, the Office of Communications, commonly known as Ofcom, to use new technology to counter phone number “spoofing,” which would prevent fraudsters from impersonating legitimate U.K. phone numbers.

According to Bloomberg, wire fraud is now the most prevalent crime in the U.K., with 1 in 15 people falling victim to it. To ensure more victims of fraud get their money back, the government aims to introduce laws that require financial institutions to reimburse victims of authorized fraud.

A report published on Jan. 29 by media outlets, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Observer, shows that organized crime syndicates are utilizing the U.K. as their operational base owing to the region’s “lenient regulations.“ Registering a company in the U.K. costs as little as 12 British pounds ($14.85). It requires no form of identification, making it easy for fraudulent companies to register there and gain sham credibility.

The U.K. government has been trying to clamp down on cryptocurrency companies operating in the region. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) mandated that all companies engaged in crypto asset activity register with it per the existing Financial Services and Markets Act rules for the digital assets market.

However, the FCA has adopted a strict approach to granting approvals, leading to several crypto-related businesses operating as unregistered entities. The regulator appears to be striving to balance providing a secure environment for investors and promoting innovation in the industry.

U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reportedly said in a statement that scammers “ruin lives in seconds, deceiving people in the most despicable ways in order to line their pockets.“ He pledged to fight these fraudsters wherever they attempt to hide. The government also promised to put an end to methods commonly used by scammers to reach thousands of people at once, such as “SIM farms.“ The use of mass-texting services will also be reviewed to prevent these technologies from falling into the hands of criminals.

The Biden administration has renewed its push for a 30% Digital Asset Mining Energy (DAME) tax on cryptocurrency miners, part of efforts to minimize the industry’s alleged impact on climate change.

The proposed crypto-mining tax was first announced on March 9 as part of President Joe Biden’s FY2024 budget and seeks to impose a phased-in 30% excise tax on electricity used by crypto-miners.

“An excise tax on electricity usage by digital asset miners could reduce mining activity along with its associated environmental impacts and other harms,” the Department of Treasury wrote at the time. Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,768

 fell under $20,000 just a day later.

However, a May 2 statement from the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has brought the proposal back to light again, in attempts to justify the need for the new tax.

“Currently, cryptomining firms do not have to pay for the full cost they impose on others, in the form of local environmental pollution, higher energy prices, and the impacts of increased greenhouse gas emissions on the climate,” the CEA wrote.

“The DAME tax encourages firms to start taking better account of the harms they impose on society,” it wrote, adding:

“While crypto assets are virtual, the energy consumption tied to their computationally intensive production is very real and imposes very real costs.”

The blog also referenced reports suggesting crypto mining has “negative spillovers” on the environment, quality of life and electricity grids and that pollution from electricity generation falls on low-income neighborhoods and communities of color while pushing up the cost of electricity for consumers.

It even suggests that crypto mining using existing clean power (such as hydropower) can still have a negative impact on the environment, by pushing other electricity users to “dirtier” sources of electricity.

The Twitter thread posted by the Council of Economic Advisers has attracted widespread criticism from the community, with some calling it “misinformation” and “propaganda,” while one Twitter user argued such a tax would “simply push Bitcoin mining to Russia & other countries.”

Amnesty nixes AI-generated images of Colombian protests after criticism

The human rights advocacy group pulled the faked images following widespread online criticism.

Human rights advocacy group Amnesty International has retracted images generated by artificial intelligence that it used in a campaign to publicize police brutality in Colombia during national protests in 2021.

The group was criticized for using AI to produce the images for its social media accounts, according to reports. One image, in particular, was highlighted by The Guardian on May 2.

It depicts a woman being dragged away by police during Colombia’s protests against deep and long-standing economic and social inequalities in 2021.

However, a closer look shows a few discrepancies in the image, such as the uncanny-looking faces, dated police uniforms and a protestor who appears to be somehow wrapped in a flag that is not the correct flag of Colombia.

The bottom of each image also carries a disclaimer saying the images are produced by an AI.

Amnesty International told The Guardian it chose to use AI to generate images to protect protesters from possible state retribution. Erika Guevara Rosas, director for Americas at Amnesty, said:

“We have removed the images from social media posts, as we don’t want the criticism for the use of AI-generated images to distract from the core message in support of the victims and their calls for justice in Colombia,”

Photojournalists criticized the use of the images, commenting that in today’s highly polarized era of fake news, people are more likely to question the media's credibility.

Media scholar Roland Meyer commented on the deleted images, stating, “Image synthesis reproduces and reinforces visual stereotypes almost by default.” Meyer added that they were “ultimately nothing more than propaganda.”

I can’t imagine an org that should NEVER use AI imagery more than @amnesty. These are real issues impacting the safety of real people in the real world. Photojournalists are out there documenting the reality. Using pretend imagery only hurts those who are suffering. pic.twitter.com/hN0SPvOFYi

Other images, now deleted by Amnesty, were shared by Twitter users in late April.

AI is being increasingly used to generate images and visual media. In late April, HustleGPT founder Dave Craige posted a video of the United States Republican Party using AI imagery in its political campaign.

Woa, this is crazy. The US Republican Party is already using Ai images in their ads. They show bleak images of what “could be” in the future.

“We all knew that AI and deep-fake images were going to make it to politics, I just didn’t realize it would happen so quickly,” he exclaimed.

Cointelegraph contacted Amnesty for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

On May 2, Srinivasan, the former chief technology officer at Coinbase, said the bet had been “closed out by mutual agreement” 45 days ahead of time.

As a settlement, Srinivasan paid pseudonymous Twitter user and self-titled “hyperinflation doubter” James Medlock $500,000, donated $500,000 to Bitcoin Core developers and gave an additional $500,000 to the non-profit charity Give Directly.

“I settled the bet ahead of time and donated even more than I had committed,” Srinivasan tweeted.

“I’m not in the habit of publicly burning a million bucks,” Srinivasan added, explaining the reason for closing out the wager around $970,000 below his target price of a $1 million per Bitcoin was because he believes “in the public good” and citizens can no longer “rely on the public sector […] to tell us when something's wrong.”

“I spent my own money to send a provably costly signal that there’s something wrong with the economy, and that it's not going to be a ‘soft landing’ like Powell promises — but something much worse.”

Despite giving away a total of $1.5 million, Srinivasan remains convinced the American economy will eventually reach a state of hyperinflation. Under his view, investors will rush to secure the value of their rapidly-depreciating dollars in Bitcoin, rapidly driving the value of the asset to reach a price of $1 million.

The high-profile wager was initiated on March 17 following a disagreement between Srinivasan and pseudonymous Twitter user James Medlock. Medlock initially tweeted that he would bet someone $1 million that the U.S. dollar would not enter any state of hyperinflation.

The conditions of the bet stipulated that if Bitcoin’s price failed to reach $1 million by June 17, Medlock would receive $1 million in the dollar-pegged stablecoin USD Coin 

USDC

$1.00

 as well as an additional 1 BTC. On the contrary, if the price of an individual Bitcoin were to be valued at $1 million by the same date, then Balaji could keep the 1 BTC and the $1 million in USDC.

Bitcoin is currently trading for just over $28,700 and has a market capitalization of $556 billion, according to Cointelegraph data.

Coinbase stock will be ‘weighed down’ until US rules are clear: Citi

The investment bank has downgraded Coinbase stock to “neutral"" amid the exchange’s ongoing battle with United States regulators.

Crypto exchange Coinbase’s stock price will continue to be “weighed down” until regulators establish the legal “rules of the road” in the United States, according to investment analysts from Citi.

According to reports on May 1, the investment bank downgraded shares of the crypto exchange from “buy” to “neutral” and lowered its price target, citing “too many unknowns” as the company battles it out with regulators.

“Until the regulatory ‘rules of the road’ are better established in the U.S., the stock will remain weighed down by this high level of uncertainty,” Citi analyst Peter Christiansen wrote in a May 1 note.

In March, Coinbase disclosed it had received a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission over possible violations of securities laws — signaling possible future enforcement action.

In April, Coinbase shot back at the SEC, filing a federal court action compelling the SEC to give clarity into the regulatory treatment of certain digital assets.

Later in the month, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Chief Legal Office Paul Grewal released a public response to the Wells notice on YouTube.

1/  Today we’re sharing our “Wells response” to the SEC. As part of our response, @iampaulgrewal and I sat down to explain why we’re confident in the facts and on the law, and why a Wells notice is not in the best interest of the US. https://t.co/zkNaWGgtcK

— Brian Armstrong ️ (@brian_armstrong) April 27, 2023

“As it stands, both long and short debates begin and end with Coinbase’s regulatory predicament,” said Christiansen, noting there could be a few ways the regulatory scuffle could play out:

“Clarity could come from: (i) a lengthy legal process vs. the SEC, where the possibility of an operating injunction cannot be ruled out, (ii) long-awaited legislative movement amidst a challenging legislative calendar and an upcoming election year, and/or even (iii) Ripple’s ongoing legal process, which could be potentially precedent setting,” the analyst wrote.

The analyst noted that the latest SEC developments don’t suggest that the parties are close to any resolution.

Its stock price slumped around 16% on March 22 after it disclosed it received the Wells notice.

The company has recently become the target of two proposed class-action lawsuits, one of which alleges it breached privacy laws in Illinois over its collection of customer biometrics, and the other alleging thacertain executives profited from insider information when the company went public.

On May 2, European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares published its latest “Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report,” which stated that the digital asset market experienced bearish sentiment for the second consecutive week, resulting in outflows totaling $72 million. The report noted that the bearish sentiment could be attributed to the probability of further interest rate hikes by the United States Federal Reserve this week.

According to the report, crypto market funds experienced outflows across all geographies and providers, particularly in Germany and Canada, where outflows reached $40 million and $14 million, respectively.

Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,768

 recorded the largest outflows at $46 million, with short-Bitcoin also experiencing outflows of $7.8 million, its highest figure since December 2022. Despite the recent outflows, short-Bitcoin continues to lead in inflows for the year, with net inflows of $119 million. Meanwhile, Ether 

ETH

$1,856

 products saw outflows amounting to $19 million, marking the biggest weekly outflows since the Merge in September 2022.

On a positive note, a small number of altcoin funds experienced minor inflows, with Solana 

SOL

$21

, Algorand 

ALGO

$0.17

 and Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8812

 each gaining less than $1 million in capital flows. 

Blockchain equities also experienced negative sentiment, resulting in outflows of $2.5 million last week, although the year-to-date net flows remain positive at $27 million.

CoinShares researcher James Butterfill authored the report. He wrote, ""Volumes remain subdued for the broader crypto market (50% less than year average) while ETP [exchange-traded products] investment product volumes at US$1.7bn for the week are 16% above the year average.""

Can Bitcoin hold $28K amid the banking crisis?

On this week’s episode of The Market Report, Cointelegraph’s resident expert discusses whether Bitcoin’s $28,000 support has a chance amid the recent banking crisis.

In today’s Market Report episode, analyst and writer Marcel Pechman discusses whether Bitcoin’s 

BTC

$27,768

 $28,000 support has a chance. Next, Pechman analyzes the First Republic Bank’s failure and its subsequent acquisition by JPMorgan. The show airs every Tuesday on the Cointelegraph Markets & Research YouTube channel.

The first news article explains why Bitcoin margin and futures indicators are essential to decide whether whales and market makers have flipped bearish as BTC failed to break the $30,000 resistance. For starters, Pechman explains why the $340-million liquidation in leveraged futures was important and how it affects the market during surprise price moves.

Using data from the OKX exchange on borrowing and lending markets, Pechamn shows how leverage was used to push Bitcoin’s price close to $30,000 on April 27 and how it played a key role in the subsequent decline to $28,000. Next, the analyst jumps to top traders’ long-to-short data provided by exchanges, which shows whales on OKX and Binance adding leveraged longs between April 25 and May 1.

The conclusion? Bears were not confident enough to add leveraged short positions, so bulls should not yet throw in the towel as margin and futures indicators remain healthy. Pechman reinforces that a dip down to $26,000 is possible, but data shows sellers are not willing to bet on such a move.

On to the show’s next topic, Pechman discusses the First Republic Bank (FRB) failure over the weekend. According to Pechman, it is definitely a bailout, as the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is getting emergency funding from the U.S. Treasury to cover the losses.

Why did Bitcoin react negatively to the event? In Pechman’s opinion, it could be two things: a) the news was already priced in, as Bitcoin rallied 7% between April 25 and April 29; b) investors interpreted the move as a strong signal from the government, meaning they won’t let any bank fail without a bailout.

Pechman’s take? The U.S. dollar has already weakened against other major currencies and will continue to devalue if the banking crisis creates other victims. Ultimately, no depositor is harmed, but the value of those dollars in the bank is worth less every month. That’s why Bitcoin will benefit, maybe not in the short term, but certainly in the span of one to three years.

In the last part of The Market Report, Pechman explains what the VIX S&P 500 volatility indicator is and why the recent 16% level, the lowest in 18 months, could mark a cycle top or low in the near term. The last time the indicator reached 15% was a month prior to the S&P 500’s all-time high in December 2021.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

The first news article explains why Bitcoin margin and futures indicators are essential to decide whether whales and market makers have flipped bearish as BTC failed to break the $30,000 resistance. For starters, Pechman explains why the $340-million liquidation in leveraged futures was important and how it affects the market during surprise price moves.

Using data from the OKX exchange on borrowing and lending markets, Pechamn shows how leverage was used to push Bitcoin’s price close to $30,000 on April 27 and how it played a key role in the subsequent decline to $28,000. Next, the analyst jumps to top traders’ long-to-short data provided by exchanges, which shows whales on OKX and Binance adding leveraged longs between April 25 and May 1.

The conclusion? Bears were not confident enough to add leveraged short positions, so bulls should not yet throw in the towel as margin and futures indicators remain healthy. Pechman reinforces that a dip down to $26,000 is possible, but data shows sellers are not willing to bet on such a move.

On to the show’s next topic, Pechman discusses the First Republic Bank (FRB) failure over the weekend. According to Pechman, it is definitely a bailout, as the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is getting emergency funding from the U.S. Treasury to cover the losses.

Why did Bitcoin react negatively to the event? In Pechman’s opinion, it could be two things: a) the news was already priced in, as Bitcoin rallied 7% between April 25 and April 29; b) investors interpreted the move as a strong signal from the government, meaning they won’t let any bank fail without a bailout.

Pechman’s take? The U.S. dollar has already weakened against other major currencies and will continue to devalue if the banking crisis creates other victims. Ultimately, no depositor is harmed, but the value of those dollars in the bank is worth less every month. That’s why Bitcoin will benefit, maybe not in the short term, but certainly in the span of one to three years.

In the last part of The Market Report, Pechman explains what the VIX S&P 500 volatility indicator is and why the recent 16% level, the lowest in 18 months, could mark a cycle top or low in the near term. The last time the indicator reached 15% was a month prior to the S&P 500’s all-time high in December 2021.

“How do we onboard the next billion users into crypto?” This is a question that gets thrown around at crypto conferences and metaverse meetups — one that people have been asking for some time. Reaching mass adoption may sound like a daunting task, but crypto media outlets like Cointelegraph help spread the news of what is going on in the cryptoverse every day, helping increase adoption.

Many people in the crypto space have likely had experiences where others ask them questions about various aspects of cryptocurrency, and trying to cohesively explain all the intricacies in one sitting can be a challenge. This tricky situation is what inspired the latest report from Cointelegraph Research.

Download the report on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.

The “ABCs of Crypto” report is a perfect start for those new to blockchain, giving a high-level overview of the major cryptocurrencies and blockchains, decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Throughout the report are links and references to all the useful resources found on Cointelegraph’s website. By combining these with other on-chain and statistical data from various sources, “ABCs of Crypto” is meant to be a starting place for those new to the space to learn about everything from why they should care about DeFi to the difference between hot and cold wallets and how NFT marketplaces work.

The world has just begun to adopt blockchain technology

Believe it or not, it took around five decades for electricity to be adopted by nearly 100% of households in the United States. It took the radio around four decades, color televisions took about three, and the internet took almost two decades. The adoption curve of modern technology seems to be getting shorter and shorter. The blockchain industry can be said to have started seeing adoption in the last five to six years. If Metcalfe’s law of exponential network effects spurred on by more users and usage holds true, blockchain may experience an even shorter adoption curve than other technologies of the past century.

DeFi and NFTs are good starting points

Finance and art are two aspects of the human experience that fit perfectly with blockchain, decentralized ledgers and all things crypto. The “ABCs of Crypto” report first focuses on understanding Bitcoin 

BTC

, then moves on to other major platforms like Ethereum before discussing decentralized exchanges. It continues on to give readers an introduction to the world of DeFi. Starting with a timeline of NFTs, the report also explores how nonfungible tokens can be used outside of digital art in the form of JPGs — including music, tickets, land and identity.

Cointelegraph Research’s latest report is a starting place to help bring new people into the world of crypto. What better way to become part of the change and put Metcalfe’s law into full effect than by helping at least one or two people hop on board and get comfortable with all that the future of money has to offer?

According to Hayes, due to the huge amount of public debt accumulated by the world’s largest economies, governments will have no choice other than ""inflating it away"" through money printing. 

Thus, the only way to escape the progressive destruction of fiat wealth is by acquiring assets outside the traditional financial system, such as crypto, the purchasing power of which doesn’t fall compared to the cost of energy. 

“My whole goal with all of my investing is to preserve capital so that I can consume the same amount of energy or whatever energy amount that I would like from now and into the future,” Hayes said in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph. 

However, the amount of crypto assets available is relatively small compared to the total amount of debt in the economy, which means that only a few will be able to preserve their capital as the majority see their wealth destroyed.

According to Hayes, the crypto crackdown in the United States reflects the government’s attempt to keep the masses within the traditional system by preventing them from fleeing to crypto.

“They want your capital to sit there and they'll make it a very pleasant, pleasant journey to lose 20, 30, 40, 50, 60% of your purchasing power over a period of time such that the debt load is effectively lowered and the finances are healthier,” he said.

Coinbase officers, board members face suit over alleged insider trading during listing

The suit charges the alleged inside traders saved over $1 billion by selling their shares when the company went public despite knowing they would lose value.

A Coinbase shareholder has filed a stockholder derivative complaint against some of the company’s executives and board members, claiming they profited from inside information during the company’s public listing. CEO Brian Armstrong and well-known venture capitalists are among the defendants.

A stockholder derivative complaint is a suit filed against a company on behalf of its stockholders. Coinbase shareholder Adam Grabski filed the suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery on May 1. Grabski bought Coinbase shares on the first day of the crypto exchange’s public listing.

According to a redacted version of the complaint posted by the court, the defendants were able to sell $2.9 billion worth of Coinbase shares made available to the public through a direct listing of the company’s stock on the Nasdaq exchange on April 14, 2021, and in the week that followed.

If the company had made an initial public offering instead of directly listing on the exchange, the defendants would have been prevented from selling their shares, and the value of the shareholdings would have been diluted.

The suit alleges that the defendants were able to sell their shares before disclosing information they already had that negatively affected the share price, which fell by more than 37% by May 18, after “the compression of the Company’s revenue margins during the first fiscal quarter and the issuance of a dilutive convertible offering were publicly disclosed.” According to the suit:

“Defendants were privy to material, non-public information about the health of the Company ahead of their multi-billion-dollar liquidity event. […] Delaware law does not permit, however […] fiduciaries trading on the basis of, and profiting from, such material, non-public information.”

The company lost over $37 billion in market value after the unfavorable disclosures. However, “Defendants, comprising a majority of the Board, sold $2.93 billion of stock” before the price fell, preventing a loss of over $1 billion to themselves. 

The suit charges breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and demands payment of damages to the company with interest, return of ill-gotten gains to the company and reimbursement of the plaintiff for expenses.

The suit names nine individuals, including Armstrong, former chief product officer Surojit Chatterjee, chief operating officer Emilie Choi, chief financial officer Alesia Hass, chief accounting officer Jennifer Jones and board members Marc Andreessen, Frederick Ehrsam, Fred Wilson and Kathryn Haun.

A Coinbase spokesperson commented on the case in an email to Cointelegraph: “As the most popular and only publicly traded crypto exchange in the US, we are at times the target of frivolous litigation. This is an example of one of those meritless claims.”

This suit was filed on the same day as a class-action suit over alleged violations of Illinois privacy laws in its Know Your Customer procedure. On the brighter side, the company launched the Bermuda-based Coinbase International Exchange on May 2.

"What is the wash-sale rule, and does it apply to crypto?","The wash-sale rule disallows the deduction of losses if identical securities or crypto assets are repurchased within 30 days.","1.
What is the wash-sale rule?

Investors cannot claim a tax loss on the sale of a security if they buy a “substantially identical” security within 30 days before or after the sale, as per the wash-sale rule, a tax regulation.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States established the wash-sale rule, which restricts investors from deducting a tax loss from their taxes if they sell an investment at a loss and subsequently buy a virtually identical security within the 30-day window. Instead, they must factor the loss into the new security’s cost base, which will reduce their gain or raise their loss when they ultimately sell the new asset.

Cost basis refers to the original value of an asset, such as a stock or a cryptocurrency, that is used to determine the taxable gain or loss when the asset is sold or disposed of. The cost basis is typically the purchase price of the asset, including any fees or commissions associated with the purchase. The cost basis may be changed to reflect the asset’s fair market value at the time of acquisition if the asset was received as a gift or through inheritance.

When an asset is sold, the capital gain or loss is determined using the cost basis. The investor obtains a capital gain and may be subject to taxation on that gain if the asset’s sale price exceeds its cost basis. The investor experiences a capital loss if the sale price is less than the cost basis. This loss can be used to offset capital gains and minimize the investor’s tax burden.

“Substantially identical” refers to securities that are almost identical to the security sold, as in the case of purchasing a stock, selling it, and purchasing the original stock back within 30 days. However, it can be difficult to determine what constitutes a substantially identical security, and the IRS has broad discretion in making this determination.

The wash-sale rule was created to stop investors from claiming tax deductions for losses while maintaining their portfolio’s original structure. All forms of securities, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds and options, are covered by this rule.

For instance, the wash-sale rule would likely apply, and the investor would not be able to claim the tax loss on the sale if the investor sold shares of a certain company at a loss and then purchased shares of the same company or a company that is similar in the same industrial sector within 30 days. In a similar vein, if an investor sells shares in a mutual fund that tracks the S&P 500 index and then purchases shares of a different mutual fund that tracks the same index within 30 days, the investor is subject to a 30-day penalty.

2.
Does the wash-sale rule apply to crypto?

Yes, the wash-sale penalty rule applies to crypto and other assets subject to capital gains taxes. However, there is no proper legislation in effect for crypto assets.

Since the IRS has not offered clear guidance on this subject, it is unclear how the wash-sale regulation applies to cryptocurrencies. The wash-sale rule is usually believed to apply to cryptocurrencies in the same manner as it does to other kinds of assets, though. 

The U.S. government tried to implement a crypto wash-sale rule through the Build Better Act in 2021, which passed in the House of Representatives but was ultimately defeated in the Senate. That said, if an investor sells a cryptocurrency at a loss and buys it in a 30-day window, the IRS considers the new purchase to be a “wash sale,” which means that the loss is disallowed and added to the cost basis of the new security.

Cryptocurrency investors may employ tax-loss harvesting opportunities and tax planning strategies to reduce their tax liability, but they must be cautious to avoid breaking the wash-sale rule.

To ensure compliance with the rule and other crypto tax requirements, it is crucial to maintain precise records of all cryptocurrency transactions. Investors in cryptocurrencies can benefit from consulting with a tax expert to better understand the complicated world of crypto taxes and make sure they are maximizing tax benefits while reducing tax obligations.

3.
How does the wash-sale rule work?

The wash-sale rule disallows the use of capital losses for tax purposes if an investor buys back a substantially identical security or crypto asset within 30 days of selling it.

Understanding the wash-sale rule and other tax regulations is crucial for crypto investors to minimize their tax liabilities and stay compliant with IRS rules. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how the wash-sale rule works:

An investor sells a security, such as a stock or a cryptocurrency, at a loss.
Within 30 days before or after the sale, the investor buys the same or a substantially identical security.
The wash-sale rule applies, and the loss is disallowed for tax purposes.
The cost basis of the new security is adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss.
If the investor later sells the new security for a gain, the adjusted cost basis is used to calculate the taxable gain.

Consider a scenario where an investor purchases 1 Bitcoin (BTC) for $50,000 and then sells it for $40,000, suffering a loss of $10,000. The wash-sale rule will be applied if the investor purchases another BTC within 30 days of the transaction for $55,000; in this case, the $10,000 loss is disallowed, and the new Bitcoin’s cost basis is changed to $50,000 to reflect this loss.

If the investor later sold the new BTC for $70,000, the taxable gain would be $20,000 ($70,000–$50,000) as opposed to $15,000, as it would have been if the cost basis had not been changed.

The wash-sale regulation barred the investor from using the $10,000 loss they sustained on the initial Bitcoin purchase, despite the fact that they had incurred a loss. The disallowed loss was instead applied to the new Bitcoin’s cost basis, raising the taxable gain from the sale of the new Bitcoin.

4.
How to avoid wash-sale rule violations?

To avoid wash-sale rule violations, investors should consider the wash-sale rule, invest in crypto mutual funds after incurring a loss from the sale of a crypto asset, or buy another asset with a very high correlation to it.

In general, investors can reduce the risk of wash-sale rule violations by waiting at least 31 days before buying back a substantially identical security or crypto asset, or by selling a security or crypto asset at a loss and immediately buying a similar but not substantially identical security or crypto asset. 

After suffering a loss from the sale of a crypto asset, buying a cryptocurrency mutual fund could be a means to avoid breaking wash-sale rules. The investor can still take part in the cryptocurrency market and possibly profit from prospects for tax-loss harvesting by investing in a mutual fund without breaking the wash-sale regulation.

Nonetheless, it’s crucial to remember that each mutual fund has its own distinct risks, so investors should do their research before investing in any mutual fund. In order to fully comprehend the tax ramifications of investing in a mutual fund and to ensure compliance with tax rules and regulations, investors should be aware of the taxes applicable in their jurisdiction.

Selling the asset that has suffered a loss and purchasing another asset that has a very high correlation to it could help one avoid violating wash-sale rules. In this way, the investor can still profit from market changes without being subject to the wash-sale rule. However, the new asset shouldn’t be nearly identical to the original asset because doing so could still result in a violation of the wash-sale regulation.

Also, before making any investment decisions, the investor should be aware of the risks and any tax repercussions connected to this strategy. Investors should always check their investments to guarantee compliance with tax rules and regulations because the correlation between two assets is a dynamic concept that is subject to change over time.","https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-the-wash-sale-rule-and-does-it-apply-to-crypto"

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer.

Untangling public wallet keys

Sending and receiving transactions over the blockchain has many advantages. Some of these include the verifiability of transactions and the immutability of the blockchain. Thanks to the blockchain, digital value can be transacted in perpetuity, like a person handing over a physical dollar bill to someone else.

However, using the technology is not so simple for everyone. Users need a certain amount of knowledge about how blockchain and their wallets work, and they also need to know how to securely send crypto to a wallet.

One of the difficulties users might experience is that public keys can be quite intimidating. They are long strings of seemingly random numbers and letters. One mistake and the crypto is either lost or ends up in the wrong wallet. And with the immutability of the blockchain, there is no way to get it back.

Where there is a need, developers get to work. One of the popular projects that aim to make crypto transactions more user-friendly is Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This platform turns these complicated wallet addresses on Ethereum into easily readable domain names, just like any website.

For a long time, however, it was impossible to integrate a comparable solution for the Bitcoin network.

A step toward ‘smart’ Bitcoin

This all changes with BTCDomain. The platform uses ordinals and zk-STARKs, short for “zero-knowledge Succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge,” to generate unique domain addresses that can be used on the Bitcoin network. But how does it work under the hood?

In essence, ordinals are unique inscriptions in transactions on the Bitcoin network. In this way, ordinals are verifiable using a blockchain explorer. BTCDomain uses this approach to associate Bitcoin domain addresses. The platform contains all the necessary metadata within a Bitcoin transaction. When a user sends BTC to one of the registered domains, for example, “satoshi.btc,” the platform resolves the underlying public key so that the BTC ends up at the correct address.

To ensure that this happens correctly, users should be able to trust that the system is resolving the transaction correctly. This is where the zk-STARK technology comes in.

One of the options is for users to run a full Bitcoin node in combination with an ordinal database on their own machine. While this is possible, it requires some technical skills and time. BTCDomain solves this problem by resolving a transaction using the resources of the platform. It inspects each Bitcoin transaction and generates a zero-knowledge proof. Users can then confirm that the domain address holds the underlying public key they are sending BTC to.

What’s more, with the latest Miami update, BTCDomain now allows users to inscribe their own website on the Bitcoin network. Thanks to the update the platform can automatically resolve domain names to the dedicated web2 website. For example, if a user owns ordinal.btc and builds an html file and inscribes it on the Bitcoin network, BTCdomain can automatically show this website on ordinal.btc.page.

Criticism against ordinals

However, the use of ordinals on Bitcoin has drawn criticism. Due to its growing popularity, the network’s activity increased significantly. In turn, this led to higher transaction fees, leading critics to oppose the use of the Bitcoin network for anything other than financial transactions. Founder of BTCDomain Jay Lee is a firm believer that it is everyone’s own choice what they do with Bitcoin: “Everyone could always use Bitcoin as a financial transaction chain. We (who believe in ‘smart’ Bitcoin) don’t affect any original use of Bitcoin. Someone might argue ordinals have pushed transaction fees higher. But we are in a free market. Whoever pays the highest gas fee rate gets included in a block. It is fair.”

According to Lee, BTCDomain brings “smart Bitcoin” closer by showing developers that it is possible to build trustless applications that rely only on Bitcoin. This could lead to a thriving decentralized finance sector built on the Bitcoin blockchain in the future.

Social media is the digital world’s go-to source for entertainment, communication and self-expression. Despite developing new ways to monetize content, this monopolized market still lacks a transparent and engaging reward system for user-generated content. On top of that, there is no trustworthy voting mechanism for crowdsourcing decisions.

For example, TikTok, a popular application that lets users create video shorts, implemented monetization features like Creator Fund and virtual gifts. However, the platform’s reward system still lacks transparency and fairness. Creators often express concern over the uneven distribution of revenue and the opaqueness of the algorithms that determine content reach and visibility.

Using the built-in paid advertising tag seems to lead to lower content views. Some successful TikTok influencers even observed their views drop after joining the fund, suspecting that the application was intentionally limiting their visibility to cap their payout. One of the influencers told Wired: “I ended up leaving the Creator Fund. I’d much rather my followers see my videos than make a few cents on views. I’m disappointed with the way it hurt people more than helped.”

Besides the lack of transparency, another issue plaguing most social media platforms is the lack of a reliable and trustworthy voting mechanism for crowdsourcing decisions. While users can gather opinions through comments, likes or informal polls, these methods are susceptible to manipulation and lack the security and verifiability required for transparent decision-making.

Privacy is king

To address the chronic lack of transparency and trustworthiness, Dutch social media platform SocialBlox is leveraging blockchain technology, with its main features revolving around decentralization, transparency and security. The all-in-one platform lets users unleash their creativity by sharing photos and videos to engage with communities.

The social media ecosystem is fueled by SBLX, SocialBlox’s native token that users can earn as a reward for using its platform and convert on secondary markets like decentralized exchanges.

To begin with, SocialBlox addresses the paramount issue of privacy by not sharing user data with third parties or using it to optimize the content algorithm. Social media giants, including Facebook and TikTok, have been accused of privacy-related wrongdoings, such as personal data leaks and misuse. SocialBlox has no revenue model for selling data. It doesn’t disclose nor sell user data to third parties.

Another feature highlighting the user-oriented approach is privacy-mode access. By default, the SocialBlox app does not show ads. Users can allow companies to show ads and collect SBLX tokens as a reward.

This app paves the way for post-to-earn platforms

Earning rewards from displaying ads is a good incentive, but the platform’s most interesting implementation is its post-to-earn initiative for users who complete challenges on the platform. With this feature, users can earn SBLX tokens by accepting challenges set by other individuals or groups. For example, users can track challenges and receive updates with a single click. They can engage followers in decisions like holiday destinations, car colors or meal choices, with the majority determining the outcome. Thanks to the transparent voting system backed by the verifiable nature of the Polygon blockchain, the application eliminates concerns of fake voting rounds. This transparent voting system also presents a significant opportunity for companies to attract participants in their voting rounds.

DOWNLOAD SOCIALBLOX FOR APPLE OR ANDROID

In the future, companies could challenge users to share a video of their newly purchased products in exchange for SBLX, or influencers could complete personalized challenges sent by their fans. And the SocialBlox app will allow creators to live a more decentralized life by providing the tools and platform to connect and share content with millions of people.

 has room to drop below $25,000 to flush out a recent influx of speculators, research shows.

In the latest edition of its weekly newsletter, “The Week On-Chain,” analytics firm Glassnode flagged the ongoing influence of “short-term holders” (STHs) on BTC price action.

Profitability reset point lies below $25,000

BTC/USD has struggled to overcome $30,000 resistance in recent weeks, and multiple fakeouts have frustrated Bitcoin bulls.

In its latest investigation into on-chain activity, Glassnode revealed that market newcomers may be responsible — speculative behavior, including profit-taking, has become prevalent in 2023.

Among the metrics contributing evidence is market value to realized value (MVRV), which tracks spot price and the on-chain cost basis of specific investor segments. STH-MVRV reflects the relationship as it impacts STHs, defined as those hodling Bitcoin for 155 days or less.

“The weekly average of this indicator, helps to identify the possibility of short-term corrections, typically seen when STH-MVRV is above 1.2, signalling a 20% unrealized profit. Macro tops tend to see even higher values, often above 1.4,” it explained.

At its latest local peak in mid-March, STH-MVRV hit 1.37 — conspicuously close to “macro top” territory and the highest score since October 2021, just before BTC/USD hit its current all-time highs of $69,000.

As of May 2, however, STH-MVRV measured 1.15 and is falling toward its 1.0 point of equilibrium, where the spot price matches the cost basis.

For that to complete, however, BTC/USD would need to fall to $24,400.

“Recent resistance was found at the $30k level, corresponding with STH-MVRV hitting 1.33, and putting new investors at an average 33% profit,” Glassnode continued.

“Should a deeper market correction develop, a price of $24.4K level would bring a STH-MVRV back to a break-even value of 1.0, which has shown to be a point of support in up-trending markets.”

Backing up STH-MVRV is a similar trend in the ratio of short-term holder unrealized profit versus loss. This, too, favors $24,400 as a bullish inflection point.

BTC supply rejuvenates

In 2023, however, it is not only short-term speculators engaging in opportunistic profiteering. Long-term holders (LTHs) have been selling into rallies, Glassnode said, unloading BTC supply onto those new market entrants.

This has increased the overall share of BTC classed as “young supply,” or that active at most six months prior.

“The rising share of younger supply during a rally is an indication of capital flowing into the market,” Glassnode stated.

“This also signals that Old Supply (> 6-months) is spending, often taking advantage of this demand liquidity, leading to a net transfer of cheap/old coins to new buyers at higher prices.”

Year-to-date, young supply has increased by 8.4%, or 366,000 BTC.

Overall, “The Week On-Chain” summarized that LTHs remain in control of the supply, with net new entries “relatively soft.”

British MP Lisa Cameron is ‘not invested personally’ in crypto but advocates for regulation

“I’m an advocate for getting regulation in place that makes the most of the potential of the sector whilst protecting consumers,” said the member of Pariliament.

Lisa Cameron, a member of Parliament in the United Kingdom since 2015, may not have used the Bitcoin Lightning Network in her time as a lawmaker, but she spends a lot of her time in office focused on digital assets.

Speaking to Cointelegraph at the Consensus 2023 conference in Austin, Texas on April 28, Cameron said she first started advocating for crypto-related policies in the U.K. government following one of her constituents being the victim of a rug pull. Since then, the lawmaker has gone on to chair the country’s Crypto and Digital Assets Group and work with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who aims to make the U.K. a “global hub for crypto-asset technology.”

“I’m an advocate for getting regulation in place that makes the most of the potential of the sector whilst protecting consumers,” said Cameron.

According to Cameron, the fallout from the 2022 crypto market crash provided the U.K. the opportunity to “sit up and take notice” of potential bad actors in the space. Regulators have already announced severe consequences for certain crypto firms not following requirements in advertising services to U.K. customers.

Though many lawmakers and regulators in the United States government seem to view crypto as a polarizing issue — e.g. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s “anti-crypto army” — Cameron suggested that digital assets seemed to be less of a partisan issue across the pond. The MP echoed Sunak’s position of making the U.K. a global hub for crypto, saying she had seen lawmakers from not just one party working to achieve that goal.

“I think in the main, it’s coming collectively from a cross-party basis of wanting to overcome obstacles, make sure that we have the guidance that we need and the regulations to maintain our position.”

Cameron added that she was “not invested personally” in any cryptocurrency due to perceived conflicts of interest that could potentially affect her objectivity in legislation. However, she added that there was a system in place allowing U.K. lawmakers to hold digital assets.

“There’s going to be very few people over the next 10 years that don’t have some involvement in this sector,” said Cameron. “I think members of Parliament are not immune to what’s going on in the real world.”

Digital asset regulation in the U.K. is partly overseen by the country’s Financial Conduct Authority, which aims to ensure crypto firms comply with Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism requirements. The U.K. government has also been moving forward on the Financial Services and Markets Bill, legislation that proposes regulating stablecoins in addition to supporting “the safe adoption of cryptocurrencies” in the country.

As the cryptocurrency industry faces regulatory challenges in the United States, public crypto exchange Coinbase is moving forward with a global derivatives platform.

On May 2, Coinbase announced the launch of the Coinbase International Exchange (CIE), a new institutional platform designed for crypto derivatives trading.

The CIE will start trading by listing Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,768

 and Ether 

ETH

$1,856

 perpetual futures later this week. All trading on the CIE will be settled in Coinbase-backed stablecoin USD Coin 

USDC

$1.00

, requiring no fiat on-ramps.

Coinbase stressed that direct access trading on CIE is available to institutional clients via application programming interface in eligible, non-U.S. jurisdictions. “These products are not available to retail customers at this time,” Coinbase added.

Coinbase didn't respond to Cointelegraph's request to comment on the exact jurisdictions where CIE will be available.

Another major crypto exchange, Gemini, also launched a non-U.S. derivatives platform on May 1. The exchange is open to customers in about 30 jurisdictions worldwide, including Singapore, Hong Kong, Bermuda, El Salvador, Philippines, Thailand and others. ""Gemini Foundation is not available to customers in the United States of America, United Kingdom, or the European Union,"" the firm stated in the announcement.

According to the announcement, the new international crypto platform is launched with support of regulators in Bermuda. As previously reported, Coinbase obtained a license from the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) by mid-April 2023. The Class F License allowed Coinbase to operate a digital asset exchange and a digital asset derivatives exchange provider as well as operate activities like token sales and issuance.

Coinbase noted that Bermuda’s regulatory environment is known for a “high level of transparency, compliance and cooperation.”

Bermuda is a self-governing British overseas territory with a parliamentary government. Similarly to the United Kingdom — where cryptocurrencies are currently legal — Bermuda has been friendly to crypto, growing increasingly bullish on the crypto industry recently.

In late April, Miami International Holdings, the operator of the Bermuda Stock Exchange, purchased remnants of the collapsed FTX crypto exchange. The company bought FTX’s futures and options exchange, and clearinghouse LedgerX for $50 million.

Previously, Bermudan Premier and Finance Minister Edward Burt declared that the government remains open to crypto despite industry failures like FTX. Last year, local authorities also stated that Bermuda would keep its crypto hub ambitions despite the industry facing a massive bear market in 2022.

The news comes amid major U.S. investment bank Citigroup downgrading Coinbase shares to neutral or high risk from buy or high risk with a $65 price target, down from $80. According to Citigroup analyst Peter Christiansen, regulatory unpredictability in the broader cryptocurrency sector is a looming threat to Coinbase.

Citi’s remarks came amid Coinbase shares already plummeting for several weeks. Over the past month, Coinbase shares plummeted more than 20%, dropping from a high of nearly $72 in April to $50 on Monday, May 1.

As previously reported, Coinbase planned to set up a global crypto exchange as of mid-March 2022. The first reports on Coinbase’s upcoming international crypto platform came just a few days before the exchange officially announced that it received a Wells notice from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In response, Coinbase filed a motion against the SEC on April 25, asking the regulator to clarify industry regulations.

Bitcoin metrics to the moon: ATH for hash rate, daily transactions and Ordinals

While the Bitcoin hash rate briefly touches new highs, Bitcoin Ordinals contribute to daily transactions exceeding 500,000.

These milestones demonstrate the network’s strength and stability, and the increasing adoption of Bitcoin for various use cases, all while the United States banking sector fractures.

The Bitcoin hash rate, a measure of the computational power dedicated to securing the blockchain, has reached an all-time high, signifying increased confidence in the network’s security. The hash rate is a crucial indicator of the network’s health, with a higher hash rate meaning more miners are participating, thus making the network more resistant to attacks.

The surge in the hash rate reflects growing investments in mining infrastructure despite fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price. More territories and regions around the world are mining Bitcoin — with increasing amounts of renewable energy — allaying fears of centralization or environmental impacts that have shrouded Bitcoin mining in the past.

However, as Denver Bitcoin, a well-known Bitcoin miner with Upstream Data, highlighted, the hash rate surge may be short-lived. It’s important to “watch 1500-block to 5k-block avg time to get an understanding of true hashrate,” he shared in a tweet:

The hash rate may be temporarily surging–partly driven by a resurgence in the popularity of Bitcoin ordinal inscriptions. Bitcoin Ordinals are unique, nonfungible tokens built on the Bitcoin network, each representing a distinct position in the Bitcoin blockchain. Each ordinal is “inscribed” on a satoshi (the smallest denomination of Bitcoin), and owners can prove digital ownership of their sats.

Ordinals have gained traction among collectors, investors and enthusiasts, offering a new way to engage with the Bitcoin ecosystem. For example, Bitcoin Ordinals fan Dan Held shares that altcoin advocates are engaging with Bitcoin for the first time due to the inscriptions.

The number of inscriptions in a 24-hour period exceeded 350,000 on May 1, as the total number of Ordinals exceeded 3 million. Given that each Ordinal inscription also counts as a transaction, the number of Bitcoin transactions has also soared.

Daily transactions reach 682,000. Source: timechainstats

As more people buy, sell and trade Bitcoin Ordinals, the number of daily transactions on the network has significantly increased to 682,000. The mempool, or the “waiting area” for incoming transactions before they are confirmed, is currently very busy. The cheapest transaction fee sits at 8 satoshis per byte, about $0.30, which is well above its lows of 1 satoshi per byte. If users want to send money to wallets on the Bitcoin base chain, the costs are significantly higher than usual due to the surging number of Ordinal inscriptions.

For some, Bitcoin Ordinals offer another role for the network that goes above its activities as a store of value and medium of exchange. For others, such as Adam Back, Ordinals are useless.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

3AC founders run into fresh trouble in Dubai over new exchange OPNX

Dubai’s digital asset regulator claimed it had sent two cease and desist notices to the exchange in February and an investor alert against it in April.

The co-founders of failed crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) — Su Zhu and Kyle Davies — have run into fresh trouble over operating and promoting their new digital-asset platform, Open Exchange or OPNX, without the required local license in Dubai.

According to a report published in Bloomberg, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) sent a written notice to Zhu and Davies along with two other OPNX executives. In a statement to Bloomberg, VARA said it is still investigating the exchange’s activities and reportedly assured corrective measures would be taken against the firm for violating laws.

The regulator reportedly claimed that OPNX had been engaged in marketing the exchange in the country through social media platforms without establishing warranted restrictions for residents of Dubai and the United Arab Emirates. VARA first discovered the exchange in February through its marketing advertisements to lure customers even before it launched.

The latest written reprimand from VARA comes after two cease-and-desist notices from the authorities in February and March. VARA said that despite the notices, they didn’t hear back from OPNX and issued an “investor and marketplace alert” against the exchange just days after its launch on April 4.

OPNX’s launch and its association with the former founders of 3AC has been a talking point in the crypto industry. The crypto community was baffled to see Zhu and Davies promoting and raising funds for a new venture, even though they are under investigation for the downfall of 3AC.

— 朱溯 (@zhusu) February 16, 2023

Zhu and Davies have distanced themselves from any further association with OPNX, reportedly telling Bloomberg that “while Kyle and I helped contribute the initial ideas for OPNX, Leslie is very much the CEO and we aren’t involved in the day-to-day.”

OPNX’s association with the former 3AC founders has not helped its fundraising efforts. On April 24, OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb blasted several venture capital firms on Twitter after some reportedly backed out of the venture. The exchange earlier claimed that it was backed by the likes of AppWorks, Susquehanna International Group, DRW Venture Capital, MIAX Group, China Merchants Bank International and Token Bay Capital.

BTC price: “Big volatility on the horizon”

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView followed BTC/USD as it returned to the $28,000 mark on Bitstamp.

The previous day’s Wall Street open had brought the latest wave of downside volatility, with the pair dipping below $27,700.

This followed a leg lower immediately after the weekly and monthly close, with $30,000 and upward feeling increasingly out of reach.

Market participants’ BTC price targets reflected the mood. Michaël van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight, argued that a rematch with both $25,000 and $30,000 was still on the table.

“Nothing is for certain, but sweep done on Bitcoin,” he told Twitter followers about the latest lows.

“Breaking through $28.4K and we could be back to $30K in a few days. Not breaking and folding coming days, $25K next. Big volatility on the horizon.”

Referring to the May 3 Federal Reserve decision on interest rate policy, a further post described Bitcoin as being “in sideways territory, where bears and bulls have arguments for both biases.”

“Lots of fear going into the event of the FED tomorrow, probably unwarranted, but we'll see. Expecting slightly deeper,” Van de Poppe added.

Bank stocks squeeze fails to inspire crypto

In terms of the Fed event itself, little was left to the imagination, with market sentiment beyond crypto pricing in an almost guaranteed 0.25% rate hike.

The odds on May 2, according to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, stood at 97.4%.

This would copy the Fed’s March decision, which was accompanied by trouble in the United States banking sector.

May 1 saw multiple local lenders shed value in an environment strongly reminiscent of six weeks prior. However, unlike then, Bitcoin appeared in no mood to capitalize on the fallout.

ARK Invest, the investment management firm founded by legendary investor Cathie Wood, has bought even more shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.

On May 1, ARK purchased 129,604 Coinbase shares for its ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to an investor notification seen by Cointelegraph.

The investment company also bought 23,456 Coinbase shares for its ARK Next Generation Internet ETF and 15,809 for its Fintech Innovation ETF. The entire purchase amounted to 168,869 Coinbase shares, worth around $8.5 million.

The acquisition makes up nearly 50% of the total Coinbase shares bought by ARK last month. In April, ARK bagged a total of 304,300 shares worth $17.5 million. Previously, ARK bought 2.4 million shares in March for about $117 million.

The latest purchases by ARK come amid Coinbase stock seeing another wave of red. On Monday, Coinbase shares dropped 6.8% amid news of a new class-action lawsuit alleging the exchange violated privacy laws.

Over the past month, Coinbase shares plummeted more than 20%, dropping from a high of nearly $72 in April to $50.1 on Monday, according to data from TradingView.

The sharp decline in Coinbase’s stock price came amid ongoing action against Coinbase by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On March 22, the securities regulator sent Coinbase a Wells notice, suggesting enforcement action against the exchange. In response, Coinbase filed a motion against the SEC on April 25, asking the regulator to answer 50 questions concerning the regulatory treatment of certain digital assets.

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

Samsung is the latest entity to take a stance against emerging generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools as they rapidly infiltrate major global industries.

According to a Bloomberg report on May 2, the company will ban the use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT among its employees. This new policy comes after Samsung staff uploaded a “sensitive code” to the platform.

Samsung told staff that as interest in AI platforms is growing, so are the security risks. The internal memo highlighted concerns over the data sent to AI platforms and its potential to be stored on external servers with little control to retrieve or erase.

“HQ is reviewing security measures to create a secure environment for safely using generative AI to enhance employees’ productivity and efficiency.”

However, it continued that until such measures are in place, the company is “temporarily restricting the use of generative AI.” This includes a ban on the use of generative AI tools on Samsung-owned computers, tablets, phones and its internal networks.

Additionally, any employees who use such tools on personal devices were asked not to submit any company information or else risk “disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.”

Related: 7,800 jobs at IBM could be replaced by AI within years, CEO suggests

In April, Samsung conducted an internal survey regarding generative AI tools, in which 65% of respondents believed the technology poses a security risk. 

Samsung is not the only major company to raise concerns about the emerging technology. Since the beginning of the year, firms such as JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have restricted or banned the usage of tools like ChatGPT.

However, many of these same companies are in the process of developing their own AI tools. JPMorgan created a ChatGPT-based tool that analyzes statements from the Federal Reserve to decipher trading signals. Samsung is also working on an AI tool for translation and summarizing documents.

Business intelligence platform MicroStrategy has reiterated its commitment to its Bitcoin

$27,744

 investment strategy after turning its first quarterly profit since 2020.

The Michael Saylor-founded firm went back into the green in the first quarter of 2023 with a profit of $94 million, which was largely attributed to a one-time income tax benefit of $453.2 million.

In addition to the tax benefit, the firm cashed in $121.9 million in revenue, up 2.2% from the same time last year.

Phong Lee, the firm’s CEO, explained in the May 1 statement that MicroStrategy’s “conviction” in its Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,744

 investment strategy is as “strong” as ever:

“The conviction in our Bitcoin strategy remains strong as the digital asset environment continues to mature.”

""We remain disciplined on costs while investing in growth, and we will continue to execute our dual strategy of growing our business intelligence software business and acquiring Bitcoin for the future,"" he added.

Lee also stressed that its “core business"" is not impacted by short-term price fluctuations in BTC.

Saylor, who serves as MicroStrategy’s chairman, attributed the successful quarter to sharp execution in the firm’s core business model and its Bitcoin investment thesis, which he described as the “right strategy,"" adding:

“So ultimately, it’s not easy to see what better strategy there might be. And so, we are strong proponents of a Bitcoin strategy. And as you can see from this chart, simply acquiring and holding Bitcoin in a prudent fashion is a pretty good way to outperform the market.""

The Bitcoin advocate predicted that investors will soon exit their positions on crypto assets that are “under the microscope in the regulatory environment,” which in turn will “flow into Bitcoin.”

MicroStrategy chief financial officer Andrew Kang added the firm also managed to reduce its leverage by repaying its $161 million Bitcoin-backed loan from the now-collapsed Silverage Bank:

“By retiring the debt, we also released all of the Bitcoin that were pledged as collateral securing the loan. This was an important and strategic transaction for us and our liability management goals.""

According to previous SEC filings, the business intelligence firm bought 7,500 BTC in Q1 across two purchases on March 23 and April 5 for a total of $179 million.

The firm now holds 140,000 BTC, which were collectively purchased at an average cost of about $29,803.

The firm’s turn to profit comes as BTC managed to rise 72% over the first quarter to about $28,300.

Related: MicroStrategy’s stock price more than doubles in 2023 in lockstep with Bitcoin

With the price of BTC at $28,100 currently, MicroStrategy is down around 5.7% on its Bitcoin investment.

The firm was however in the “green” for a period of time last month when BTC skyrocketed to its most recent high of $30,980 on April 15.

The software analytics firm began investing its cash reserves into BTC on March 5, 2021, when it bought 91,064 BTC — 65% of its total holdings today.

Saylor recently revealed that MicroStrategy integrated Bitcoin Lightning into his corporate email address.

The Bitcoin-savvy firm is also in the process of developing a Bitcoin layer-2 Lightning Network-based Software as a Service tool for corporations.

Bitcoin hash rates threaten blockchain decentralization

The blockchain industry is facing a massive power imbalance — just like the traditional finance industry.

Blockchain technology was introduced in 2008 as a decentralized, secure, transparent system for managing digital transactions. Its primary aim was to provide a solution to major problems with traditional transactional systems, including trust, security, decentralization and efficiency. Blockchain has since expanded beyond finance and has been used in supply chain management, healthcare, games, digital media and social media, among others. 

However, the blockchain industry is still facing significant challenges — such as a lack of diversity, wealth control by a few holders, hash rate problems and a loss of the promise of decentralization.

Hash rate and why it’s a problem

The cryptocurrency on everyone’s mind — and in the digital wallets of more than 400 million people around the world — is Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,744

. Bitcoin’s hash rate is the computing power required to validate transactions and produce new blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain. A high hash rate is necessary to maintain the integrity of the Bitcoin network, but it also presents some significant challenges.

Hash rate distribution among the largest mining pools for the six months ending April 25, 2023.

One of the most pressing issues is the high energy consumption required to maintain a high hash rate. As more miners join the network, the hash rate increases — and so does the energy consumption required to sustain it. The environmental impact of BTC mining has led to concerns throughout Bitcoin’s volatile history and rise to mainstream fame.

Another challenge with Bitcoin’s hash rate is the centralization of mining power in a few large mining pools. As the hash rate has increased over time, it has become increasingly difficult for individual miners to compete with these large pools, leading to concerns about the potential for these pools to monopolize the network and control the direction of Bitcoin’s development.

Related: Elizabeth Warren wants the police at your door in 2024

There is also the potential for 51% attacks by mining pools that control the majority of the hash rate. If a single mining pool or a group of mining pools controls over 50% of the hash rate, they could potentially control the network and carry out malicious activities, such as double-spend attacks or rewriting transaction histories. This presents a significant threat to the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network.

Finally, the limited scalability of the Bitcoin network is another challenge associated with its hash rate. As more users join the network and the number of transactions increases, the network can become congested, leading to slow transaction times and high fees. This can limit its utility as a viable payment system and has led to ongoing debates within the Bitcoin community about how to address these scalability challenges.

Phantom decentralization comes in many forms

The blockchain industry has quickly fallen into a massive imbalance of power, mirroring the traditional finance industry. The concentration of wealth and power within a small group of individuals has created an industry that is far from decentralized. Those who were early adopters of blockchain technology, particularly Bitcoin, were able to accumulate large amounts of wealth through mining, investing and trading.

This has led to a concentration of wealth and power within a small group of individuals. The complexity of blockchain further limited early adoption to a minuscule percentage of people in the tech world. This concentration of power and wealth has made it difficult for new players to enter the market and challenge the dominance of established players.

The high barriers to entry have also contributed to the imbalance of power in the blockchain industry. The cost of setting up and running a successful blockchain project can be significant, and not everyone has the resources or expertise to do so. This has made it difficult for new startups to enter the market and challenge the dominance of established players.

Network effects also play a role in the imbalance of power in the blockchain industry. Blockchain networks rely on network effects, which means that the value of the network increases as more people use it. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where established networks become increasingly dominant, making it harder for new networks to gain traction.

From phantom decentralization to the real thing

Despite the challenges facing the blockchain industry, there are ways to address these issues and create a more sustainable, equitable system.

One of the most pressing issues with Bitcoin’s hash rate is its high energy consumption. To address this, the industry could move toward using renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power, to power mining operations. This would not only reduce the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining but also make it more sustainable in the long run.

To address the issue of limited scalability in the Bitcoin network, efforts should be made to improve the underlying technology. This could include the development of new protocols or the adoption of existing protocols, such as the Lightning Network, which could significantly improve the speed and efficiency of Bitcoin transactions.

Finally, greater efforts should be made to educate people about blockchain technology and its potential. This could be achieved by providing greater access to information and resources, offering training programs and workshops, and working with educational institutions to integrate blockchain into their curricula.

Industry heavyweights respond to UK’s crypto asset regulatory framework proposal

HM Treasury was directed to spot problems that may need refinement, but the basic principles of its approach were heartily welcomed.

The deadline has come for comments on a consultation paper and call for evidence released by the United Kingdom’s HM Treasury on a proposed crypto asset regulatory framework. The long-awaited paper, published in February, drew detailed responses from a variety of cryptocurrency industry players.

Blockchain provider Polygon Labs, venture capitalists Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) and the Digital Pound Foundation (DPF) released their responses on May 1 to the call for comments. Among these diverse voices, some common issues were raised.

The Treasury’s call for “same risk, same regulatory outcome” was well met, although there was no uniform understanding of what that entailed, aside from its basis in the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000. California-based a16z pointed out weaknesses in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s dependence on the Howey test as the firm assessed the U.K. proposal. In its response, a16z wrote:

“It is encouraging that the Treasury’s interpretation of this principle recognises that it does not mean it will be appropriate to apply exactly the same form of regulation in all cases to achieve the same regulatory outcome.”

This tied into the proposal’s emphasis on regulating activities, rather than assets themselves. The basic differences between centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) were central to this discussion. Polygon wrote:

“The source of risk in DeFi systems is significantly different than that in centralised systems, like CeFi or the traditional financial system. To this end, it may be more accurate to update: ‘same risk, same regulatory outcome’ to ‘different source of risk, same regulatory outcome.’""

The proposed framework treated fiat-backed stablecoins and algorithmic stablecoins differently, classifying algorithmic stablecoins as an “unbacked cryptoasset.” Polygon particularly favored the activity-based regulatory approach in this case.

Related: UK Treasury seeks input on taxing DeFi staking and lending

The AFME, which worked with consulting firm Clifford Chance on its response, noted the importance of a global taxonomy of crypto assets for effective international regulation and the ""same activities"" approach to exclude blockchain-based representations of value such as loyalty and rewards programs.

The AFME also identified the territorial scope of the proposed crypto regulations, which are written to apply to companies that provide services to U.K. nationals. That is a broader scope than regulations concerning traditional assets have, it noted.

The DPF perceived possible deviations from the “same risk, same regulatory outcome” principle in the handling of several forms of crypto assets, and it commented on them in detail. The classification of stablecoins was one of the points it thought needed clarification in this regard.

The U.K. government will respond to the collected responses it received to its paper and engage in further consultations on specific rules as its next step, if they are “taken forward.”

Liquid staking tokens to fuel the next DeFi boom

Liquid staking tokens are poised to drive the next wave of DeFi adoption, offering users increased rewards and opportunities in the wake of Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade.

LSTs revolve around the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling Ether (ETH) stakers to benefit from yield farming opportunities while their ETH tokens are locked to maintain the network that recently upgraded to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Liquid staking protocols provide users with LSTs in exchange for their locked ETH based on a 1:1 ratio to let them explore DeFi use cases during the staking process. Some protocols call these substitute tokens “liquid staking derivatives” (LSDs), but LST is a more accurate term since it represents ownership of staked ETH.

How will ETH’s Shanghai upgrade impact the DeFi space?

Following the Shanghai upgrade (also called Shapella), more ETH is expected to be staked, which will stimulate the liquid staking sector and boost DeFi. We may see another DeFi boom similar to that of 2020 when Compound and its native token COMP made waves to trigger the DeFi summer. This time, LSTs have the chance to become the face of DeFi instead of DEXs and lending protocols.

Shanghai is a major Ethereum upgrade that allows stakers to withdraw their staked tokens for the first time since the Beacon Chain was integrated at the end of 2020. It is estimated that about 1.1 million ETH tokens have become instantly withdrawable. While some of it will likely be sold through exchanges, a great part of it might be used for staking purposes again, and this time, liquid staking protocols will be flooded.

Suspicions mount over First Republic contagion

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD dropping to multi-day lows at the time of writing.

The pair continued a comedown that began after the weekly and monthly candle close, shedding over $1,000 since that time.

The start of the week saw a potential volatility catalyst during Asia trading as First Republic Bank was sold to JPMorgan Chase by the U.S. government.

Amid suspicions over the legitimacy of the move, First Republic became the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history.

Bitcoin showed little interest in mimicking its reaction to the start of the banking crisis in March, instead tracking lower despite warning signs that another lender might already be in trouble.

This came in the form of PacWest Bancorp, the stock of which, PACW, saw a 7% drop on the day to return to its lowest levels in a month.

For Marty Bent, founder of crypto media company TFTC, the behavior was “eerily similar” to First Republic. PACW was down nearly 60% year-to-date on the day, while FRC, now suspended indefinitely, had dived 97%.

Despite the turmoil and potential looming continuation, U.S. equities were calm at the open, leaving crypto markets on the more volatile end of the risk asset spectrum.

Reacting, traders considered the possibility of a comedown in advance of the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates due on May 3.

This was nonetheless already heavily priced in by markets, which anticipated a 0.25% hike as a near certainty despite the banking fragility. Data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool measured the probability at 94% on the day.

Dollar strength faces “huge week”

One asset, meanwhile, showing keen strength to start the week was the U.S. dollar, with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) challenging its highest levels since mid-April.

“Huge week coming up, particularly for the US dollar. Expect defensive positioning leading into Wednesday,” financial commentator Tedtalksmacro wrote in part of ananalysis.

He argued that markets should not “expect” the Fed to hint at a pivot or freeze of rate hikes at this week’s meeting, this in itself boosting the dollar and risk-off sentiment.

A prior thread flagged key correlations for observers, these including DXY versus BTC.

On May 1, cryptocurrency exchange OKX announced that it would be listing memecoin Pepe (PEPE) at 17:00 Hong Kong Time (HKT) and open Pepe withdrawals on May 2 at 17:00 HKT. In supporting the listing decision, OKX staff wrote: 

“Pepe the Frog is a cartoon character and internet meme created by cartoonist Matt Furie. Pepe was designed to be a green frog with a human-like body; this is one of the most popular memes in the world.”

Several cryptocurrency exchanges, including MEXC Global, Bitget, Gate.io and Huobi, listed Pepe trading pairs two weeks prior, stirring what appears to be a trading frenzy. The token has returned 2,340% since April 17 and is now trading at $0.000001223 apiece at publication. Following news of the OKX listing, Pepe’s price has surged over 50% in the past 24 hours.

Created on the Ethereum blockchain by anonymous developers, the Pepe token was created, according to CoinMarketCap, “as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme,” with the aim of capitalizing on the popularity of memecoins such as Shiba Inu 

SHIB

$0.000009

 and Dogecoin 

DOGE

$0.07

.

In 2021, DOGE surged by over 23,000%, partly due to American business magnate Elon Musk’s vocal support for the coin on social media. Similarly, SHIB surged by over 1,250% during the 2021 cryptocurrency bull market after gaining tailwind popularity from its sister Dogecoin token. Despite the recent traction, OKX staff wrote in its Pepe listing announcement: 

“Digital assets are innovative investment products with high price fluctuations and risks. Before investing, [OKX] hopes you have a full understanding of digital assets, rationally judge your investment ability, and make investment decisions prudently.”
